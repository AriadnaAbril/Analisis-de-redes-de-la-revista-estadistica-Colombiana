Universidad  Industrial de Santander;Universidad Nacional de Colombia
Abstract
In drinking water treatment we found appropriate linear models to explain dose and concentration of sulphate, dose of lime, lime application probability and polymer application probability, including as explanatory variables some physical and chemical properties of raw water.
Keywords: Water treatment, Generalized Linear Models.
Introduction
This study was developed in a water treatment plant located in Girardot (Colombia), whose source is the Magdalena River. The treatment of drinking water comprises the aeration, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection of raw water. To remove undesirable substances, mechanical and chemical procedures are used. Colloidal particles are separated from water by means of a chemical coagulation process consisting in the charge destabilization of the suspended particles by adding a coagulate substance, usually aluminum sulfate. The chemical coagulation is performed for several reasons, mainly to remove organic and inorganic turbidity; color, true and apparent; harmful bacteria and other pathogens; plankton and hardness. As a common practice, aluminum sulfate is applied in a quantity experimentally determined by jars test. 
Since raw water is taken from a river, frequent measurements of variables such as turbidity level, color and alkalinity are needed to carry out the jars test to determine the dose of coagulate. Time and operation costs make it desirable to use a statistical model to establish optimal doses of sulfate, lime and polymer to be applied to water, based on turbidity, color, temperature, pH, alkalinity and hardness.
    The raw water variables, object of this study, present the following variation
intervals: turbidity 200 − 1200 NTU, color 50 − 250 UC, pH 7.1 − 8.33, alkalinity
43 − 55 mg/l CaCO3, hardness 43 − 50 and temperature 24 − 28o C. The results
and conclusions found in this paper are restricted to those conditions, though
the methodology can be used to optimize the treatment process in other water
treatment plants.
    Linear models were initially used to describe the behavior of aluminum sulfate
optimal dose, its optimal concentration of application, and lime optimal dose, as
a function of the water properties (McCullagh & Nelder 1996). Finally, logistic
models were used to show how the application of lime and polymer are related to
the raw water properties (Agresti, A. 1990).


2.     Physical, Chemical and Dosage Variables
2.1.   Physical Variables
    Turbidity is the optical effect caused by the dispersion and interference of a
bright ray through the water having colloidal particles in suspension. These par-
ticles are formed by organic or mineral matter in untreated waters, by aluminum
hydroxide in treated waters, by iron oxide in corrosive waters or by microorgan-
isms and other substances. The turbidity units are equivalent to SiO3 p.p.m. and
receive the name of turbidity nephelometric units (NTU). Drinkable water has 1
NTU and it is considered not drinkable if turbidity is higher than 5 NTU.
    Color is due to solution substances. The universal method for color determi-
nation is a visual comparison of a sample contained in Nessler pipe of 50 ml, with
permanent patrons. Those made by chlorine-potassium platinate and cobalt chlo-
ride which are contained in identical pipes. In treated waters the desirable value
is 5 UC (color units). The permissible maximum value is 15 UC.
    Temperature in treated water should be pleasant to the senses and give a sen-
sation of fresh water. According to the french regulation, the water temperature
should lie between 9 and 12 o C. A temperature higher than 15 o C favors microor-
ganisms development in the channels and intensifies odors and flavors.

2.2.    Chemical Variables
    The chemical variables refer to mineral elements or organic compounds that
exist in water and may affect its quality according to established norms. The
chemical properties generally considered are: pH, alkalinity, hardness, electrical
conductivity, acidity, CO2, residual chlorine, calcium contents, magnesium, iron,
chlorides, sulfates, nitrogenous compounds and toxic substances contents (Rodier
1981). Technical restrictions of the firm where the study was carried out limited
the variables to pH, alkalinity, and water hardness.
    pH (pH) is an indicator of the concentration of hydrogen ion in solution, and
is measured in mol per liter. pH indicates the intensity of acidity or alkalinity of
a substance and is defined by pH = - log [H+]. In treated waters pH values lie
between 7 and 8.5. However values between 6.5 and 9 are considered acceptable.
    Alkalinity (ALC) is the measure of the power of one solution to neutralize the
hydrogen ions and is expressed in terms of one equivalent quantity of calcium car-
bonate. In natural waters the total alkalinity represents the contents of hydroxides
(OH), carbonates (CO3) and bicarbonates (HCO3). In general terms, treated wa-
ter should not have too low values to produce corrosion neither too high to produce
incrustations.
    Water hardness (DUR) is due to the presence of calcium and manganese salts.
Although these salts do not affect the water sanitary qualities, precipitate insoluble
compounds allowing to form incrustations in distribution and heating systems.
The water hardness for domestic consumption should be between 30 and 50 mg/l
of CaCO3. Water hardness only is included as explanatory variable in the linear
model explaining the aluminum sulfate optimal concentration.


2.3.    Dosage Variables
    Dosage variables are the optimal doses of aluminum sulfate, polymer and lime
necessary to get drinking water (American Public Health Association 1985).
    Aluminum sulfate optimal dose. To calculate the required dose of coagulate,
laboratory tests should be made using the jars test. To measure the aluminum
sulfate optimal dose, an equipment with a mechanic agitator whit 4 to 6 palettes,
which operates at velocities from 0 to 100 r.p.m., a floc illuminator placed in the
agitator base and precipitation glasses of 2000 ml of capacity are used.
    The aluminum sulfate optimal dose is obtained by adding coagulate to water
in progressive doses in each precipitation glass. The samples are injected in the
mechanical agitator jars setted on 100 r.p.m. If water alkalinization is required, it
should be made before coagulation test.
    After 30 seconds to 2 minutes of quick mixture, starting from coagulate ap-
plication, speed is diminished to the velocity selected as the optimal flocculation
condition, and then, the samples are flocculated for five to twenty minutes. After
this, agitation is suspended, the palettes are removed and water is sedimented
during five to ten minutes.

     Samples are taken from each of the jars and turbidity is measured. The alu-
minum sulfate optimal dose will be obtained from the jar where the smallest tur-
bidity and color values were found. This dose, denoted by D SU L, will be taken
as the quantitative response for the linear model analysis.
     Figure 1 shows the behavior of residual turbidity as a function of aluminum
sulfate dose. The lowest admissible value of turbidity is got by the application
of 40 mg/l of sulfate. This quantity was the minimum necessary so that the
conditions of turbidity of water become acceptable for human consumption and
it is considered, for initial water conditions, the optimal dose to apply as D SU L
value. The initial conditions of water used for the data determination, were the
following: turbidity 200 NTU, color 100UC, pH 8.03, alkalinity 40 mg/l CaCO3
and temperature 24o C.

    Polymer optimal dose (D P OL). Once the test to determinate aluminum sul-
fate optimal dose is realized and a polyelectrolite has been chosen, the polyelectro-
lite optimal dose is obtained by the following test: The aluminum sulfate dose is
reduced (for example in 75% of the optimal dose) and a variable quantity of poly-
electrolite is added, having into account technical conditions and health entities
recommendations, or maintaining constant the polyelectrolite dose and changing
the aluminum sulfate quantity to obtain the lowest cost so that the dose of alu-
minum/polyelectrolite gives the water acceptable conditions for human consump-
tion. If water quality in the plant changes through time, testing should have to
proceed to new turbidity and/or color conditions.

true residual color and residual pH will be necessary to determine the polymer
optimal dose, denoted by D P OL.
   Lime optimal dose (D CAL). To determine the lime optimal dose we took
a sample of 1000 ml of treated water with both aluminum sulfate and polymer
optimal doses. If the pH is smaller than 7, a lime solution is applied to get this
value. The lime quantity needed to get a pH equal to 7 is called the lime optimal
dose, denoted by D CAL.
   The Aluminum sulfate optimal concentration (C SU L)is considered as a dosage
variable, and its values are determined experimentally. A jars test is done in the
conventional form and the sulfate optimal dose is determined according to the
experimental procedure described before.
   This test is made using a coagulate solution of 10 g/l (1%) with pH between
4 and 4.5. In five precipitate glasses with the same quantity of sample water, the
optimal dose determined in the jars test, with different coagulate concentrations,
such as 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% are added.

    After mixturing, the water is flocculated and deposited. During this process
both the floc size (Willcomb index) and the reaction velocity (floc formation initial
time) are evaluated. Next, turbidity and residual color in the clarified water are
determined. The concentration applied in the jar with the smallest turbidity and
residual color is called the optimal concentration.
    Figure 2 shows the C SU L value for some characteristics of raw water. In
this figure it is also shown how the concentration in the application of aluminum

sulfate optimal dose significatively influences the residual turbidity behavior and
how, for some values of C SU L concentration, in each case, the residual turbidity
is smaller. This corresponds to the glass of the optimal concentration of aluminium
sulfate application. The initial conditions were: turbidity 500 NTU, alkalinity 58
mg/l CaCO3, pH 7.38, temperature 27o C.


3.     The Water Treatment Data
    In the water treatment plant of Girardot, the measurement of physical, chem-
ical and dose variables are made after a sedimentation process, in which heavy
materials are separated from water by gravitation.
    Throughout 1997 we measured turbidity, color, alkalinity, pH, temperature and
sulfate optimal dose. In order to determine the statistical model to explain the
sulfate optimal dose, we selected measures of 40 samples of raw water, considering
the variability of raw water data properties. In 20 of these samples we measured
the optimal concentration for the sulfate application.
    During the same year we carried out 33 experiments to determine the lime
optimal dose for water treatment. In each one of these experiments we also mea-
sured turbidity, color, alkalinity, pH and temperature of raw water. To determine
the probability of lime application and polymer application, 60 observations were
taken from the water treatment plant registers.


4.     Linear Model to Explain Sulphate Dose
   We considered turbidity (TURB), color (COL), alkalinity (ALCA), pH (PH)
and temperature (TEMP) as explanatory variables of the dose of Sulphate (D SUL)
variable behavior (dependent variable). The resulting linear model is

      D SU L = β0 + β1 T U RB + β2 COL + β3 ALCA + β4 P H + β5 T EM + 

where  ∼ N (0, Iσ 2 ). The determination coefficient is R2 = 0.991. After backward
elimination procedure with an elimination criterion of 0.01, the final model is:
        b SU L = −13.571 + 0.085T U RB + 1.592T EM P
        D                                                      R2 = 0.991       (1)

The p-values are all smaller that 0.01 and there is not lost of information when
COL, ALCA and pH are dropped out from the model. Result (1) shows that the
optimal dose of sulphate to be applied in water treatment depends basically on the
turbidity and that low temperatures favor the coagulate action. If temperature
has low values a less sulphate dose is required.
   Table 1 shows the simple correlations between the variables included in the
study. The 0.01 and 0.05 bilateral significance levels are indicated by ∗∗ and ∗,
respectively. The table shows the highest correlation between sulphate dose and
turbidity with a value of 0.978.

5.    Optimal Concentration of Sulphate Dose
   In this section we select the best linear model for the explanation of the sulphate
concentration behavior. As before, we take an initial model of the form:

               C SU L = β0       + β1 T U RB + β2 COL + β3 ALCA
                                 + β4 P H + β5 T EM P + β6 DU R +                (2)

with R2 = 0.530 and p-values higher than 0.05 for partial hypothesis βk = 0,
k = 0, 1, . . . , 6. After the elimination process we found model (3) with R2 = 0.413.
                         b SU L = −1.597 + 0.445P H
                         C                                                        (3)

   This model has intercept p-value=0.133 and slope p-value=0.003. We could
consider a zero intercept model, but we prefer the last model, since it is better to
predict concentration for a particular value of pH in the interval [7.1,8.33].


6.    Linear Model to Explain Dose of Lime
   Model (4) were used to explain dose of lime. We found R2 = 0.930 and p-values
higher than 0.05 for H0 : βi = 0, i = 3, 5.

 D CAL = β0 + β1 T U RB + β2 COL + β3 ALCA + β4 P H + β5 T EM P +                (4)

With the BACKWARD elimination process we found model (5), with R2 = 0.915.
       b CAL = 59.374 + 0.01262T U RB + 0.07746COL − 8.831P H
       D                                                                          (5)

   All the p-values are smaller than 0.01. Thus, the optimal dose of lime to be
applied in water treatment depends basically on turbidity, color and pH.


7.    Lime Application Probability
   We will determinate the lime application probability in water treatment in
the water plant of Girardot, from data set of lime, a dicotomic variable with a

value of one if it is applicated and 0 otherwise and turbidity, color, alkalinity, pH
and temperature as quantitative variables corresponding to physical and chemical
properties of raw water that may have influence in the lime application probability.
    Initially model (6), where p = P r(lime = 1|turb, col, alca, ph, temp), were con-
sidered. For this model D∗ (M ) = 2(ls − lM ) = 15.79 with 27 degrees of freedom
and p-value equal to 96%, with ls denoting the logarithm of the likelihood function
for the saturated model and lM , the logarithm of the likelihood function for the
proposed model.

 logit(1 − p) = β0 + β1 T U RB + β2 COL + β3 ALCA + β4 P H + β5 T EM P +  (6)

The result, after the elimination procedure, is model (7), with parameter p-values
less than 0.002 and D ∗ (M ) = 2(ls − lM ) = 7.91, with 11 degrees of freedom and
p-value equal to 72%.
                                                          1
             p̂ = P̂ (lime = 1|int, COL) =                                       (7)
                                             1 + exp(5.91 − 0.040COL)

    If in the model: logitP (lime = 0|COL, P H) = β0 + β1 COL + β2 pH, we
eliminate the intercept, which has a higher p-value than the explanatory variable
pH, we obtain model (8). It has parameter p-values less than 0.002 and D ∗ (M ) =
2(ls − lM ) = 17.92, with 30 freedom degrees and p-value equal 96%.

                                                       1
         p̂ = P̂ (lime = 1|COL, P H) =                                           (8)
                                         1 + exp(−0.042COL + 0.813P H)

   This model shows that the probability of lime application grow up from 0 to 1,
when the color grow up from 50UC to 250UC.


8.    Polymer Application Probability
   We will determinate the polymer application probability in the water plant of
Girardot, from data set of polymer, a dicotomic variable: polymer = 1 if lime is
applicated and 0 otherwise, and turbidity, color, alkalinity, pH and temperature as
quantitative variables corresponding to physical and chemical raw water properties
that can have influence in the polymer application probability.
   We initially consider the global model with all explanatory variables and apply
the same process as before. We found model (9) with parameter p-values less than
0.002 and D ∗ (M ) = 2(ls − lM ) = 15 .39 , with 20 degrees of freedom and p-value
equal to 75%.

                                                            1
        p̂ = P̂ (polymer = 1|int, T U RB) =                                      (9)
                                              1 + exp(6.55 − 0.0138T U RB)
    If, in the model logitP (polymer = 1|T U RB, pH) = δ + β1 T U RB + β2 pH, we
eliminate the intercept, with higher p-value than pH, we obtain model (10) with

parameter p-values less than 0.002 and D ∗ (M ) = 2(ls − lM ) = 14.11, with 30
degrees of freedom and p-value equal to 96%:
                                                              1
  pb = Pb(polymer = 1|T U RB, pH) =                                               (10)
                                              1 + exp(−0.0152T U RB + 0.925pH)

   Figure 3 shows the behavior of polymer application probability for model (10)
with turbidity and pH as explanatory variables.

   This model shows that the probability of polymer application grows up rapidly
from 0 to 1, when the turbidity grow up from 300unt to 600unt.


9.           Conclusions
     The best linear models obtained to explain the optimal dose variables are:
                     b SU L = −13.571 + 0.085T U RB + 1.592T EM P
                     D                                                            (11)
                     b CAL = 59.374 + 0.01262T U RB + 0.07746COL − 8.831pH
                     D                                                            (12)

   These models can be used to predict the optimal dose of aluminium sulfate and
lime, optimizing the drinking water process. Aluminium sulfate optimal dose can
be predicted if we know the turbidity and temperature of raw water. Lime optimal
dose can be predicted if we know turbidity, color and pH of raw water.

    In model 11, temperature appears to have influence on the sulfate optimal
dose, since, for instance, larger values in the water temperature interval improve
the flocculation process as time for mixing and precipitation gets shorter.
    In model 12, dose of lime is explained as a linear combination of turbidity, color
and pH. From the model, the optimal dose of lime decreases when pH increases.
Higher values of turbidity in raw water requires larger sulfate dosages making pH
to decrease because of the liberation of hydroxide ions in the coagulation process;
then, water needs to be neutralized to the pH standards for drinking water.
    The concentration of sulfate dose can be predicted, if we know the pH value,
through the model C   b SU L = −1.597 + 0.445P H. It can be used to optimize the
water drinking treatment, getting precision in the experimental process to obtain
the application optimal dose.
    The logistic models 6 and 9 show (i) values of color where lime application is
highly probable, (ii) values of turbidity where the polymer application is highly
probable, and (iii) the pH relation in chemical process. This model also can be
used to optimize the experimental process and to establish control quality process.
    In the treatment plant of Girardot the models have been applied with favorable
results and allow: (i) to predict the optimal dose of sulfate and lime and to get a
better precision in experimental process. (ii) to establish supervision and control
process. (iii) to optimize the treatment process at a lower cost.
    This study should be developed in similar water treatment plants and extended
to other process including the same or new variables.
