Statistical Studies of Age Specific HIV Prevalence Data

Abstract
The infectivity function is a function giving a measure of how infectious a given individual is t time units after becoming infected. Today, no feasible and ethically acceptable study design is known, which would lead to estimates of HIV-infection probability within steady heterosexual partnerships, using standard statistical methodology. In this paper a transmission model is used as a link between the infectivity function and data sets which already exist or can be generated with standard methods and moderate expenses. This model suggests that the distribution of HIV-infections by age and sex depends on the infectivity function as well as on age-dependent patterns of sexual partner choice. Application of the model requires population based data of age specific HIV-incidences in men and women of the general heterosexual population. At present, the only known data set suitable for this purpose is a set of HIV-test results from a sample of 8690 Colombian women in pregnancy who attended prenatal care. The prevalence of HIV was 0.33% in the group of 12-24 years, but only 0.16% in the group of 25-34 years. The model can explain this strange result. A data set of age-specific HIV-prevalences in heterosexual Colombian men would be useful, but is not known. Therefore, further research and data collecting is required in order to arrive at well founded conclusions.

Introduction
Infectious disease data have two features that distinguish them from other data.
They are highly dependent and the infection process is only partially observable.
A consequence of these features is that the analysis of data is usually most effective
when it is based on a model that describes aspects of the infection process, i.e.
on a transmission model (Becker & Britton 1999). The core of any transmission
model is the infectivity function. This is a function b(t) giving a measure of how
infectious a given individual is t time units after becoming infected. Knowledge
about the infectivity function is of great public health interest. Remember that
the most used method of disease control in the 19th century and before has been
the isolation of infected persons. Still a few years ago, isolation has been used for
the control of the new lung disease SARS. But when should isolation begin, and
when should it end?. The answer depends on the infectivity function. The spread
of an infectious disease is at once a biological and a social phenomenon. Therefore,
any mathematical model describing this process must take into account the types
of social behavior that are related to the transmission of the infectious agent. This
is especially true in the case of HIV, the causative agent of AIDS. The sexual
transmission of HIV in groups with different behavior requires different models
with different parameters.
    During the early stage of mathematical modeling of the AIDS epidemic, until
1988 say, it was assumed that the infectivity function of sexually transmitted HIV
is constant during all the incubation period of AIDS and falls to zero at its end. The
event of transmitting HIV from an infective to a susceptible partner by c contacts
was conceived as the first success in a series of c independent Bernoulli trials with
parameter b. So, the probability of being infected after c contacts with an infected
partner would be P (c) = 1 ‚àí (1 ‚àí b)c . This is equivalent to P (t) = 1 ‚àí e‚àígt when

infection is considered as the first event of a Poisson process with intensity g. Early
deterministic models in continuous time, e.g. the model in Dietz & Hadeler (1988),
have usually assumed a Poisson process with constant intensity. For heterosexual
pairs it has been admitted that b might be different depending on whether the
infective partner is male or female. In any case, P would be a strictly increasing
function of c or t, respectively.
     This way of thinking has changed after the publication of a study by
Peterman et al. (1988). Since this study involved only heterosexual pairs in which
one partner had become infected by blood transfusion, the number of acts of
intercourse with the infected partner could be estimated rather accurately. The
surprising result of this study was that pairs in which transmission had not oc-
curred reported about twice as many sex acts than pairs in which the spouse of
the index case was HIV-positive at the end of the study.
     Two hypotheses that could explain these data have been proposed. One hypo-
thesis assumes that HIV-transmission in a partnership with n sexual contacts can
still be conceived as a possible outcome of n independent Bernoulli trials with
probability of success b, but that b varies according to a high-low-high pattern
during the incubation period of AIDS. Formally, this can be written as:
                            Ô£±
                            Ô£≤ bo          0 < t < t1
                    b(t) =     Œ≤‚àí        t 1 < t < t2    0<<Œ≤
                               Œ≤+
                            Ô£≥
                                          t 2 < t < t3
where t1 is between 4 and 8 weeks, and t2 is greater than 5 years.
    The papers of Hadeler (1989) y Dietz et al. (1993) are based on this hypothesis
which may be called the modified Bernoulli model. The other hypothesis implies
that the infection probability per partnership varies between pairs (and perhaps
also in time) and that an uninfected partner becomes infected around the time of
the first sexual contact in a partnership or never (soon-or-never model). This is
assumed by Watts & May (1992).
    Today, studies such as that of Peterman et al. (1988) are no longer possi-
ble because HIV-infections by blood transfusion are extremely rare. No feasi-
ble and ethically acceptable study design is known, which would lead to esti-
mates of HIV-infection probability within steady heterosexual partnerships, using
standard statistical methodology. Therefore the idea of this paper is to use a trans-
mission model as a link between the infectivity function and data sets which al-
ready exist or can be generated with standard methods and moderate expenses. A
model for the spread of HIV via steady heterosexual partnerships was proposed by
Knolle (2004a). This model can be used to predict the age-distribution of HIV-
infections in a population (sometimes called the general population) of hetero-
sexual men and women who have sexual contacts only within a steady mono-
gamous partnership and do not have any other risk of infection with HIV. Let‚Äôs
first look at some data sets of age-specific HIV-prevalences in different countries.
After that the transmission model will be presented, and it will be explained how
the model and the data can be used in order to infer properties of the infectivity
function.

2     Data from Colombia, Burundi and the United
      Kingdom
A major difficulty in obtaining HIV-data from the general population is to sepa-
rate HIV-tests of people with high sexual mobility from tests of people in steady
partnerships. Perhaps the best way out is to look for data of pregnant women in
prenatal care and of men who make an HIV-test as prerequisite for a life insurance
contract, because a high percentage of these people is likely to live in a steady
partnership. Surely, a selection bias is always possible, if the test is voluntary.
    An unlinked anonymous HIV-test is a test that is made for purely epidemio-
logical reasons, such that the test result cannot be linked to personal identifiers.
Unlinked anonymous testing of pregnant women who attend prenatal care pro-
vides estimates of HIV-prevalence in the general female population which are
almost free of selection bias. Colombia is one of the very few countries in which
this epidemiological tool has been applied. The following data are taken from a
bulletin published by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (2000). During 8 weeks in
1999 all women who attended prenatal care in selected health cares at 12 different
locations were tested, giving a total of 8690 tests among which 21 were positive
(Table 1).

    During the same campaign, all men and women who attended general medical
in selected health cares, and all men and women who attended consultation for
sexually transmitted diseases (STD) were tested. Tables 2 and 3 show data for
Colombian men and women who consulted for STD, respectively.
    The data for men will not be considered here, because the percentage of homo-
sexual men among these is unknown, but may be high. In order to have specific
data for heterosexual men which can be compared with the data for women in
Table 1, one must go to a region with high HIV-prevalence in the heterosexual
population, e.g. Africa.
    Table 4 shows HIV-prevalence in different age groups in a sample of 1254 men in
Bujumbara, the capital of Burundi (Saidel et al. 1996). All men in the sample were
workers from five companies who were invited to participate on a voluntary basis
in a longitudinal study to determine the annual incidence rate of HIV-infection.
The choice of this data, that can be criticized in view of cultural and genetic

differences between the populations of both countries, is partly justified by the
scarcity of HIV-data for heterosexual men.
    In a previous paper, this author has argued that in growing populations the
patterns of mixing between age-groups show typically a higher frequency of part-
nerships between young women and older men than in nongrowing populations
(Knolle 2005). Such patterns lead to higher values of the epidemic threshold pa-
rameter of HIV and may also influence the age-distribution of HIV-prevalence (see
below). In order to compare these predictions with observed trends, data such as
those of Table 1, but from developed countries, would be helpful. But it seems
that anonymous unlinked testing of representative samples of the general popula-
tion is rarely carried out in developed countries. As a surrogate, Table 5 shows
the numbers by age of all heterosexual HIV-infections in women between 15 and
44 years, diagnosed between 1999 and 2003 in the United Kingdom (UK).
    Now we can make some preliminary comparisons. At the 5% level, the jump

in Burundi is significant (Table 4). In order to compare among age-groups in
(Table 5), it is necessary to calculate the number of HIV diagnoses per 1 million
women in each group. This can be done easily for the data of 1999, because for
that year general census data are available (UN Demographic Yearbook 2002). The
results are shown in parentheses. Similarly to men in Burundi, HIV incidence in
women in the UK younger than 25 is significantly lower (at 5%) than in women
between 25 and 29 years, the confidence limits being 47 and 77 for 61, and 80 and
120 for 100 (Sachs 1984, pp. 267).
    In sharp contrast to these results, in pregnant women in Colombia the es-
timated prevalence is highest in the age-group from 12 to 24 years (Table 1).
But greater samples are needed, because with the present data the hypothesis
p1 = p2 = p3 cannot be rejected at the 5% level (the chi-square is 2.5 with 1 d.f.).
If the trend shown in Table 1 would be confirmed by the results of the study carried
out in 2004 (in spite of several attempts these data could not be obtained from
the Instituto Nacional de Salud), the age-distribution shown in Table 1 could be a
feature typical for HIV-infections in monogamous women in growing populations.
Support for this thesis will be found in Section 4.


3     The Threshold Phenomenon
A central theorem of the stochastic theory of infectious diseases is the epidemic
threshold theorem. It states that in large populations, there will be either minor
epidemics or major epidemics with hardly any epidemics of a size between these
two extremes. The epidemic threshold parameter R0 has the property that a major
epidemic is an event of positive probability if and only if R0 > 1. For a homo-
geneous population, R0 is the mean number of infections caused by one infective
person who is introduced into the totally susceptible population. Its actual value
depends both on the biology of the infection process and on social behavior of
the host population. Figure 1 shows the probability distribution of the final size
of an epidemic due to an air-borne viral infection in a school class of 16 children
when R0 = 2.56 and the number of contacts is Poisson-distributed. The calcula-

    So long as the overall prevalence is low, the spread of an infectious disease in a
heterogeneous population can be modeled with a multitype Galton-Watson process
(Becker & Marschner 1990). The number of types is the number of classes into
which the population is partitioned. The entry mij of the mean matrix M = (mij )
is the mean number of infections of type j generated by an infection of type i. The
process is called positively regular, if for some n all entries of M n are positive. The
largest eigenvalue of M is the epidemic threshold parameter R0 , usually called the
basic reproduction number. Due to the theorem of Frobenius, this eigenvalue is
simple, and R0‚àín Z0 M n converges to a positive left eigenvector for any Z0 . Further-
more, E(Zn ) = Z0 M n (Harris 1963).
    Today it is evident that R0 in the general heterosexual population of Europe
and most of Asia and the Americas is less than 1, and that all infections in these
populations are due to finite infection chains with origin in a country or group,
where HIV is already endemic or an HIV-epidemic is going on. Generalized HIV-
epidemics, with prevalence of more than 10 in the general population, are seen in
sub-Saharan Africa and in the Caribbean. In the past, Colombia was a country
with great cultural differences between its Caribbean and Pacific coastal regions
and the Andean highlands where the capital city BogotaÃÅ is situated. Due to in-
creased mobility and migration between the regions, the sexual behavior of people
younger than 35 years is somewhere between the extremes of traditional catholic
morality and the permissiveness of the coastal areas. Therefore, it is probable that
the R0 of HIV in the general population is a little less or a little greater than 1.
As known from the theory of branching processes, infection chains are finite when
R0 < 1, but can become quite long when R0 approaches 1.

4     The Transmission Model
A branching process which describes HIV-transmission in the monogamous hetero-
sexual population has been defined in Knolle (2004a):
Definition 1. Suppose that men have at most k and women have at most m part-
nerships during their life. The partnership-infection process is a Galton-Watson
process with k + m types which are defined as follows:

      for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k type i is a man who acquired infection in his i-th partnership
      for k + 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k + m type i is a woman who acquired infection in her
      (i‚àík)‚àíth partnership.

    The generating functions of this process are calculated on the basis of the
following probabilities:

    ‚Ä¢ cij = probability that a man in his i-th partnership has a partner who is in
      her j-th partnership (i = 1, ., k; j = 1, . . . , m);
    ‚Ä¢ dij = probability that a woman in her i-th partnership has a partner who is
      in his j-th partnership (i = 1, . . . , m; j = 1, . . . , k);
    ‚Ä¢ uil = probability that a man infected in his i-th partnership will infect his
      l-th partner (i = 1, . . . , k ‚àí 1; l = i + 1, . . . , k)
    ‚Ä¢ vil = probability that a woman infected in her i-th partnership will infect
      her l-th partner (i = 1, . . . , m ‚àí 1; l = i + 1, . . . , m).

    The epidemic threshold parameter R0 is given by the largest eigenvalue of
the mean matrix of this Galton-Watson process. In the present case, however,
the process is not positively regular, but it is still true that there is a positive
probability of a major epidemic if and only if R0 > 1 (Knolle 2004a).
    The conditions of this model allow also to include episodes of infidelity. If a
stable partnership with number i is interrupted by an episode of infidelity, this
episode must be numbered i + 1 and the continuation of the partnership must be
numbered i + 2.
    We call C = (cij ) and D = (dij ) the mixing matrices of the process. The
problem of assigning realistic values to the entries of these matrices has not yet
been solved completely. The major problem is that in most countries the only
available data refer to marriages, whereas data on informal partnerships do not
exist. Some issues of the Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations contain
the special topic ‚ÄúNuptiality‚Äù, for example the issue for the year 1982 published
in 1984. In that issue, Table 29 is a cross-table for age of both spouses, and Table
30 is a cross-table for previous marital status of both spouses. If one compares
data from countries with rapidly growing and with slowly growing or constant
populations, then two typical patterns can be observed. Everywhere the mean age
at first marriage is some years higher in men than in women. The difference is in

the correlation. Indeed, the correlation between age of groom and age of bride is
weaker in rapidly growing populations, because unions between elderly men and
very young women are frequent (Table 6).

    A similar trend is seen in cross-tables of marital status before marriage. In
constant populations many divorced women marry again, and most divorced men
marry a woman who is also divorced. In rapidly growing populations most divorced
men marry a woman who never married before, and most divorced women do not
marry again.
    The following assumptions are partly justified by the marriage patterns in
rapidly growing populations. It is assumed that marriage may be preceded by two
informal partnerships.

                                   k = 4, m = 3

    This means that a woman in her i‚àíth partnership (i = 1, 2, 3) with probability
1‚àíhi has a partner who also is in his i‚àíth partnership, but with probability hi has
a partner who is in his fourth partnership. We suppose that condoms are not used
in steady partnerships. About the infection process the following assumptions are
made:

   1. Nobody knows its own or the infection status of his (her) partner.

   2. If an infectious and a susceptible person form a pair, transmission occurs
      soon or never.


                                      Revista Colombiana de Estadƒ±ÃÅstica 29 (2006) 181‚Äì194

  3. The infectivity function has three phases with different levels.
  4. Any partnership is longer than the first phase.
  5. Any partnership is shorter than the second phase.
  6. The first three partnerships together are longer than the incubation period
     of AIDS.

    Assumption number 4 implies that the level of the first phase does not appear
in the model. The other assumptions can be formalized with the following values
of the infection probabilities:

            u12 = u23 = u34 = a ‚àí Œ¥,
            v12 = v23 = b ‚àí Œµ,
            u13 = u24 = a + Œ¥,
            v13 = b + Œµ,
            u14 = 0                                (‚àía ‚â§ Œ¥ ‚â§ a, ‚àíb ‚â§ Œµ ‚â§ b)

   The zero rows and columns are due to the fact that this process is not positively
regular. The positive square root of

                        Ro2 = 2h1 (ab ‚àí Œ¥Œµ) + h2 (a ‚àí Œ¥)(b ‚àí Œµ)                         (1)

is the largest eigenvalue of M , and Ro2 is an eigenvalue of M 2 with linear indepen-
dent eigenvectors

                 V1 = (0, h1 (b ‚àí Œµ), h1(b + Œµ) + h2 (b ‚àí Œµ), 0, 0, 0, 0)
                 V2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, h1, h2 , 0)

    Equation (1) shows the strong influence of the mixing pattern (h1 and h2 ) and
of variable infectivity (Œ¥ and Œµ) on R0 . Data such as that in Table 6 (age < 20)


                                        Revista Colombiana de Estadƒ±ÃÅstica 29 (2006) 181‚Äì194

indicate that h1 is surely greater in Ecuador than in Switzerland, but a formal
estimation procedure is not yet available. In non-growing populations such as
that of Switzerland and other European countries, the patterns of partner choice
tend to symmetry, i.e. women usually have as many partners during life as men,
and the mixing matrices are identical and symmetric. The general model of the
partnership-infection-process can be applied to this case, too. For example:
                                                                        1
            let k = m = 3, uij and vij as before, and for 0 < h <         let
                                                                        2

                         Ô£Æ                                         Ô£π

                     C=D=Ô£∞ h                  1 ‚àí 2h           h Ô£ª

  In this case we have:
         2ah       (a ‚àí Œ¥)(1 ‚àí 2h) + (a + Œ¥)h              (a ‚àí Œ¥)2h + (a + Œ¥)(1 ‚àí 2h)
     Ô£Æ                                                                                Ô£π

 A = Ô£∞(a ‚àí Œ¥)h              (a ‚àí Œ¥)h                             (a ‚àí Œ¥)(1 ‚àí 2h)      Ô£ª

and the same expression for B, when a is replaced by b and Œ¥ by Œµ. In the case
h = 31 (uniform mixing) we find, according to equation (6.2) in Knolle (2004a):
                                        Œ¥    Œµ
                               R02 = a ‚àí     b‚àí                                       (2)
                                         3      3

    The corresponding eigenvectors of M 2 are:

                                 V1 = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
                                 V2 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

    This means that for uniform mixing between age groups, the risk of HIV-
infection would be independent of age.
    For other values of h, an explicit formula for R0 is not available, but it can be
shown numerically that R0 is an increasing function of h.
    For a = b = 0.6, Œ¥ = Œµ = 0.4, h = 0.2, one obtains R0 = 0.291, whereas h = 13
implies R0 = 0.467, according to equation (2). The nonzero components of the
eigenvectors are 0.2, 0.255, 0.545. This means that the incidence of HIV-infection
increases with age.


5     Towards Parameter Estimation
The HIV-epidemic in Colombia is of a type that the World Health Organization
calls a concentrated epidemic. This means a situation in which a self-sustained
epidemic is occurring only in some small groups at high risk, but with infection
chains radiating from these groups into the general population. Therefore, the


                                      Revista Colombiana de Estadƒ±ÃÅstica 29 (2006) 181‚Äì194

192                                                                         Helmut Knolle


adequate mathematical model for the spread of infection in the general population
is the Galton-Watson process with immigration. Quine (1970) has proved that
under fairly general conditions the distribution of types of a subcritical multitype
Galton-Watson process with immigration converges to a stationary distribution. In
the present case however, it is more convenient to derive the stationary distribution
directly.
    Consider a usual way by which an infection can be imported into the general
population. Suppose a man has himself become infected by contact with a female
sex worker and then infects his actual or his next steady partner. In this case,
the ancestor of the partnership-infection process is a woman in her first, second
or third partnership, i.e. Z0 = e5 , e6 , or e7 , where ei denotes the i-th unit vector
(i = 1, . . . , k + m), and E(Z1 ) is, respectively,

                            e5 M = (0, b ‚àí Œµ, b + Œµ, 0, 0, 0, 0)
                            e6 M = (0, 0, b ‚àí Œµ, 0, 0, 0, 0)
                            e7 M = 0

   For E(Z2 )we find:

                      e5 M 2 = 2(ab ‚àí Œ¥Œµ)(0, 0, 0, 0, h1, h2 , x)
                      e6 M 2 = (a ‚àí Œ¥)(b ‚àí Œµ)(0, 0, 0, 0, h1, h2 , y)

where the values of x and y have no impact on further generations, since e7 M = 0.
   We continue and find

        e5 M 3 = 2(ab ‚àí Œ¥Œµ)(0, h1 (b ‚àí Œµ), h1 (b + Œµ) + h2 (b ‚àí Œµ), 0, 0, 0, 0)
        e6 M 3 = (a ‚àí Œ¥)(b ‚àí Œµ)(0, h1 (b ‚àí Œµ), h1 (b + Œµ) + h2 (b ‚àí Œµ), 0, 0, 0, 0)

   Since these are multiples of the eigenvector V1 of M 2 , we conclude that

                      E(Z2n+1 ) is a multiple of V1 for all n > 0

Furthermore, a simple calculation shows that

              E(Z2n ) is of the form: Œª(0, 0, 0, 0, h1, h2 , x) for all n > 0

   Of course, the generations Z0 , Z1 , . . . are not observable separately. What can
be observed is always a superposition of different generations of several distinct
branching processes.
   When R0 is < 1, but sufficiently near to 1, the total of generations Z2 , Z3 , . . .
tends to outweigh Z0 and Z1 .
   If X 1 , . . . , X 7 denote the observed numbers of infections of type 1, . . . , 7 in a
given moment, then it can be hoped that

               X3                             b + e h2    X6    h2
                      is approximated by           +   and 5 by
               X2                             b ‚àí e h1    X     h1

                                       Revista Colombiana de Estadƒ±ÃÅstica 29 (2006) 181‚Äì194

               X3     X6
    Therefore 2 ‚àí 5 is a statistic for a test of the hypothesis Œµ > 0 against
               X      X
H0 : Œµ = 0. Its expectation for H0 is 1, but the variance is not known to the
author.
    Furthermore, if Œµ > 0 then it may be concluded that X 3 must be greater than
  2
X , independently of h2 and h1 , whereas X 6 can be expected to be smaller than
X 5 whenever h2 < h1 .
    In contrast to these results, the expected age-distribution of HIV-infection is
increasing with age for both men and women, if the mixing pattern is symmetric
and old-with-young mixing is rare. This can be seen from a numerical calculation
of the eigenvectors in the mean matrix M (see the example in section 4).
    An anonymous referee has suggested to use the data of the tables in section 2 for
an estimation of the R0 of Colombia. Unfortunately, the data available at present
and the theory developed so far are not sufficient for this purpose. For example,
the data of Table 1 are prevalence data, but what is really needed is incidence data.
Furthermore, data of heterosexual men are totally lacking. Further progress would
require close collaboration between mathematical statisticians and the personnel
of public health institutions.



6     Applications to Public Health
The use of condoms is the most recommended method of control of the HIV-
epidemic. But many heterosexual pairs usually do not use condoms. Knowledge of
the infectivity function as defined in the introduction can lead to recommendations
that take this fact into account. If it is true that the infectivity of HIV varies in time
according to a high-low-high pattern and that the first phase of high infectivity
is shorter than two months, then an obvious recommendation would be: take a
period of two months of abstinence between the last and the first sexual contact
with two different partners, and make sure that any new partner follows the same
rule. A second recommendation, derived from equation (1), is directed at reducing
the frequency of old-with-young mixing and implies the advice for women, to be
cautious with older men or, if a partnership with an old man is strongly desired,
ask him first to make an HIV-test.
