Regression Models with Heteroscedasticity using Bayesian Approach
Universidad Nacional de Colombia;Universidade de S√£o Paulo
Abstract
In this paper, we compare the performance of two statistical approaches for the analysis of data obtained from the social research area. In the first approach, we use normal models with joint regression modelling for the mean and for the variance heterogeneity. In the second approach, we use hierarchical models. In the first case, individual and social variables are included in the regression modelling for the mean and for the variance, as explanatory variables, while in the second case, the variance at level 1 of the hierarchical model depends on the individuals (age of the individuals), and in the level 2 of the hierarchical model, the variance is assumed to change according to socioeconomic stratum. Applying these methodologies, we analyze a Colombian tallness data set to find differences that can be explained by socioeconomic conditions. We also present some theoretical and empirical results concerning the two models. From this comparative study, we conclude that it is better to jointly modelling the mean and variance heterogeneity in all cases. We also observe that the convergence of the Gibbs sampling chain used in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for the jointly modeling the mean and variance heterogeneity is quickly achieved.
Key words: Socioeconomic status, Variance heterogeneity, Bayesian methods, Bayesian hierarchical model.
Introduction
    Approximately 62% of Colombian children and teenagers lack of a satisfactory
nutritional level and do not reach an optimal level of physical development. To get
information about nutritional levels of this population, we model the mean of indi-
vidual tallness in two groups of people, since the mean is one of the main nutritional
level indicators. The first one includes children aging between 0 and 30 months old
that belong to high socioeconomic level. The second one is a sample of people ag-
ing between six months and 20 years old that belong to lower, medium and higher
socioeconomic strata. Tallness seems to be influenced by genetic factors (Chumlea
et al. 1998), but the genetic homogeneity of the studied population seems to be
apparent. Given that our main goal is to analyze this data set taking into account
the variance heterogeneity, it is convenient to consider an analysis with explicit
modeling of the variance, including age and socioeconomic stratum as explanatory
variables. In this case, the variance can be modeled through an appropriate real
function of the explanatory variables that takes into account the positivity of the
variance (Aitkin 1987, Cepeda & Gamerman 2001). Thus, one possibility to ana-
lyze this data set is to use linear normal models with variance heterogeneity; other
possibility is to consider hierarchical models (Bryk & Raudenbush 1992). The
linear normal models with variance heterogeneity have two components: a linear
function characterizing the mean response and a specification of the variance for
each observation. In Section 2, we summarize the classical (Aitkin 1987) and the
Bayesian methodologies (Cepeda & Gamerman 2001) used to fit these models. In
the second model, a normal prior distribution is used and, given the orthogonality
between mean and variance, a simple iterative process to draw samples from the
posterior distribution can be performed. Hierarchical models are commonly used
in educational and social statistics (Bryk & Raudenbush 1992, Raudenbush &
Bryk 2002) to analyze this type of data. In this area, it is natural, for example, to
consider that students are nested within classrooms and classrooms within schools;

individuals nested within socioeconomic stratum; groups may be nested in organi-
zations (Steenbergen & Bradford 2002), and so forth. In this paper, we present, in
Section 3, a general theoretical review of hierarchical models, since our intention
is to use this model approach to analyze data taking into account the variance
heterogeneity. For this purpose, we initially apply linear regression model with
random coefficients (De Leeuw & Kreft 1986, Longford 1993). In Section 4, an
application section, we initially compare standard linear normal regression models
with regression models modelling the heterogeneity of the variances and standard
normal regression models with regression models with random coefficients. Next,
we analyze a people tallness data set, including age and socioeconomic stratum as
explanatory variables. In this case, we include dummy variables and interaction
terms between the dummy variables and one or more predictors in the modeling
of the mean. However, since in general, it is not enough to model the contextual
heterogeneity (Steenbergen & Bradford 2002), we consider a joint normal regres-
sion model for the mean and for the variance heterogeneity, where indicator and
interaction factors are included in the mean and variance model. Here, we also
analyze the data set using hierarchical models, including as many dummy vari-
ables as there are subgroups (socioeconomic stratum) in the second level to take
into account the contextual differences. In all the applications, several explana-
tory models have been fitted and we include in all the cases, the estimates for the
parameter of the model that produces the most satisfactory fit.



2. Modelling Variance Heterogeneity in Normal
   Regression
    In this section, we summarize classical and Bayesian methodologies to get
jointly maximum likelihood and posterior estimates, respectively, for the mean and
variance parameters in normal regression models assuming variance heterogeneity.


2.1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation Using the Fisher
     Scoring Algorithm
    Let yi , i = 1, . . . , n, be the observed response on the i-th values xi = (xi1 , . . . , xip )0
and zi = (zi1 , . . . , zir )0 of the explanatory variables X = (X1 , . . . , Xp ) and Z =
(Z1 , . . . , Zr )0 , respectively. Given the parameter vectors Œ≤ = (Œ≤1 , . . . , Œ≤p )0 and
Œ≥ = (Œ≥1 , . . . , Œ≥r )0 , if the observations follow the model
                                                        
                         yi = x0i Œ≤ + i , i ‚àº N 0, œÉi2 , i = 1, . . . , n                    (1)

where œÉi2 = g(zi , Œ≥) and g is an appropriate real function, the kernel of the likeli-
hood function is given by
                                                               i2 

    Thus, given that the Fisher information matrix is a block diagonal matrix, an
iterative alternate algorithm can be proposed to get maximum likelihood estimates
for the parameters (Aitkin 1987). The summary of this algorithm, as it is presented
in Cepeda & Gamerman (2001), is given in the next steps.

  a) Give the required initial values Œ≤ (0) and Œ≥ (0) for the parameters.

  b) Œ≤ (k+1)
           is obtained
                       from Œ≤ (k+1) = X 0 W (k) X X 0 W (k)      Y , where W
                                                                                (k)
                                                                                    =

                                                ‚àí1 0
  c) Œ≥ (k+1) is obtained from Œ≥ (k+1) = Z 0 W Z      Z W Ye , where W = 21 In , with
     In the n √ó n identity matrix, and Ye is a n-dimensional vector with i-th
     component

                                        œÉi
      where Œ∑i = zi0 Œ≥.
  d) Steps (b) and (c) will be repeated iteratively until the pre-specified stopping
     criterion is satisfied.


2.2. Bayesian Methodology for Estimating Parameters
    To implement a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of the model
(1), we need to specify a prior distribution for the parameter of the model. For
simplicity, we assign the prior distribution, p(Œ≤, Œ≥), given by
                                                     
                           Œ≤              b        B C
                                ‚àºN            ,
                           Œ≥              g       C0 G

as in Cepeda & Gamerman (2001, 2005). Thus with the likelihood function L(Œ≤, Œ≥)
given by a normal distribution, and using the Bayes theorem, we obtain the pos-
terior distribution œÄ(Œ≤, Œ≥ | data) ‚àù L(Œ≤, Œ≥)p(Œ≤, Œ≥). Given that the posterior distri-
bution œÄ(Œ≤, Œ≥ | data) is intractable and it does not allow easily generating samples
from it and taking into account that Œ≤ and Œ≥ are orthogonal, we propose sampling
these parameters using an iterative alternated process, that is, sampling Œ≤ and Œ≥
from the conditional distributions œÄ(Œ≤ | Œ≥, data) and œÄ(Œ≥ | Œ≤, data), respectively.
Since the full conditional distribution is given by

                            œÄ(Œ≤, data | Œ≥) = N (b‚àó , B ‚àó )                         (2)

where b‚àó = B ‚àó (B ‚àí1 b + X 0 Œ£‚àí1 Y ) and B ‚àó = (B ‚àí1 + X 0 Œ£‚àí1 X)‚àí1 , with Œ£ =
diag(œÉi2 ), samples of Œ≤ can be generated from (2) and accepted with probability 1
(Geman and Geman, 1984). Since œÄ(Œ≥ | Œ≤, data) are analytically intractable and
it is not easy to generate samples from them, the following transition kernel (3) is
proposed to get posterior samples of the parameters using the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm.
                                q(Œ≥ | Œ≤) = N (g ‚àó , G‚àó )                        (3)

distribution of Œ≥, given by the combination of the conditional prior distribution
Œ≥ | Œ≤ ‚àº N (g, G) with the working observational model yei ‚àº N (zi0 Œ≤, œÉi2 ), where yei
is defined in item c), above. In this case, the quantity Œ∏ is updated in two blocks
of parameters, Œ≤ and Œª. One of these blocks is updated in each iteration, as it is
specified in the following algorithm:
                                                                                           
  a) Begin the chain iteration counter in j=1 and set initial chain values Œ≤ (0) , Œ≥ (0)
     for (Œ≤, Œ≥)0 .

  b) Move Œ≤ to a new value œÜ generated from the proposed density (2).

  c) Update the Œ≥ vector to a new value œÜ generated from the proposed density
     (3).
                                                                             
  d) Calculate the acceptance probability of the movement, Œ± Œ≥ (j‚àí1) , œÜ . If the
     movement is accepted, then Œ≥ (j) = œÜ. If it is not accepted, then Œ≥ (j) = Œ≥ (j‚àí1) .

  e) Finally, update the counter from j to j +1 and return to b) until convergence.


3. Hierarchical Models
    Hierarchical data are commonly studied in the social and behavioral sciences,
since the variables of study often take place at different levels of aggregation. For
example, in educational research, this approach is natural since the students are
nested within classroom, classrooms within schools, schools within districts, and
so on. In the two-level hierarchical models, given by N individuals nested within
J groups, each one containing Nj individuals, if for simplicity we only consider
one explanatory variable X, the first stage of the analysis is defined by
                                                               
                    Yij = Œ≤0j + Œ≤1j Xij + ij , ij ‚àº N 0, œÉ 2                    (4)

where Yij is the random quantity of interest associated to the i-th individual
belonging to j-th group, Œ≤j = (Œ≤0j , Œ≤1j )0 is the parameter vector associated to
the j-th strata, j = 1, 2, . . . , J, and ij is the random error associated to the i-
th subject belonging to j-th strata (Van Der Leeden 1998). In a second level,
the regression coefficient behavior is explained by predicted variables of level 2,
through the model

                              Œ≤0j = Œ≥00 + Œ≥01 Zj + Œ∑0j
                                                                                     (5)
                              Œ≤1j = Œ≥10 + Œ≥11 Zj + Œ∑1j

where Z denotes the set of explanatory variables of level 2, and Œ∑kj ‚àº N (0, œÉk2 ),
k = 0, 1. In this model, Z is a context variable where its effect is assumed to be
measured, for example, at the socioeconomic stratum, rather than at the individual

level. To complete the model, conjugate prior distributions are assumed for the
hyperparameters.
    The two level models are obtained by substitution of Œ≤0j and Œ≤1j , given by (5),
into (4). Thus,

           Yij = Œ≥00 + Œ≥01 Zj + Œ≥10 Xij + Œ≥11 Zj Xij + Œ∑1j Xij + Œ∑0j + ij           (6)

    In this model, given the error structure, Œ∑1j Xij + Œ∑0j + ij , there is a het-
eroscedastic structure of the variance conditioned to the fixed part Œ≥00 + Œ≥01 Zj +
Œ≥10 Xij + Œ≥11 Zj Xij . Thus, for each group

                                               ej0 + œÉe2 INj
                                        e j Œ£2 X
                            V ar(Yj ) = X                                            (7)

where X ej = (1Nj , Xj ), with Xj = (X1j , . . . , XNj j )0 . In (7) it is assumed that
              
eij ‚àº N 0, œÉe2 , that (Œ∑0j , Œ∑1j ) ‚àº N (0, Œ£2 ) and that the Level-1 random terms are
distributed independently from the Level-2 random terms.
    There are several ways to specify the level-2 model (Van Der Leeden 1998). If
Z consists only of a vector of ones, the model specifies a random variation of the
coefficient across the two units level. Such models are called Random Coefficient
Models (De Leeuw & Kreft 1986, Prosser et al. 1991). In our applications, we
consider models where the intercept and slope parameters are random, but there
are other possibilities. For example, a simple model with random intercept and
fixed slope can also be considered for use in practical work.
    To implement a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of Hierarchical
models, we include an appendix where we show the analytical processes to obtain
the posterior distribution of interest.


4. Applications
    In this section, we introduce some examples of growth and individual devel-
opment studies for Colombian population. Studies about children‚Äôs growth and
development are very important in clinical research because they allow detection
of factors which can affect children‚Äôs health. As a first example, we consider a
sample of babies between 0 and 30 months old. All the selected children in this
example belong to a high socioeconomic stratum with a good welfare. In a second
example, we consider a data set given by a group of 311 Colombian individuals
aged from 6 months to 20 years old, sampled from different socioeconomic strata.
For these examples, we consider as response variables of interest, the height mea-
sures for the individuals in the sample in order to concentrate on an appropriate
specification of the time and socioeconomic stratum dependence.


4.1. Growth and Development of Babies
    In this section, we analyze the growth and development of some groups of ba-
bies between 0 and 30 months old. The data set was selected by Pediatricians of

                                      Revista Colombiana de Estad√≠stica 32 (2009) 267‚Äì287

Bogota‚Äôs hospitals and by students of Los Andes University from the beginning of
2000 to the end of the year 2002. The data set shows some interesting characteris-
tics: (a) the height increases with time but it does not have a linear behaviour as
shown in figure (1). (b) Sample variance is not homogeneous; it seems to increase
at an initially small time interval and then it decreases.


4.1.1. Applying Model 1
                                                          ‚àö                             
    For this data, we assume the model Yi = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1 ti + i , where i ‚àº N 0, œÉi2
and œÉi2 = exp(Œ≥0 + Œ≥1 ti ). Here Yi is the tallness of the i-th babies at age ti . The
models were fitted by using a vague prior for the parameters. In allcases, we
assigned a normal prior distributions Œ≤i ‚àº N 0, 105 and Œ≥i ‚àº N 0, 105 , i = 1, 2.
The number 105 was chosen to impose large prior variances, but, as we have already
checked in our analysis, increasing this value to larger orders of magnitude made
no effective difference in the estimation process. Thus, the posterior means and
standard deviations for the model parameters are given by: Œ≤b0 = 48.408(0.728),
Œ≤b1 = 7.990(0.221), Œ≥b0 = 2.303(0.2529), Œ≥ b1 = ‚àí0.038(0.022). Estimated values for
the correlation parameters are presented in table 1. From Table 1, we see that
Corr(Œ≤0 , Œ≤1 ) and Corr(Œ≥0 , Œ≥1 ) are significatively different from zero. Statistically,
the correlation between Œ≤-s and Œ≥-s are equal to zero. This result agrees with the
diagonal form of the information matrix.

    Figure 1 shows the plot for the posterior mean height of babies and the corre-
sponding posterior 90% credibility interval. From this figure, we can see that the
babies, all of whom have nutritional wealth, have tallness between international
standards according to NCHS. Thus, there is no evidence of problems in the growth
process. It is important to see that tallness is the most important parameter to
validate the nutritional state and growing condition of babies. Figure 2 shows the
behavior of the chain for the sample simulated for each parameter, where each one
has small transient stage, indicating the speed convergence of simulation for the
algorithm. The chain samples are given for the first 4500 iterations. The other
results reported in this section are based on a sample of 4000 draws after a burn-in
of 1000 draws to eliminate the effect of initial values. In Figure 3 we have the his-
tograms for the posterior marginal distributions of parameters. These histogram
seem to show that the posterior marginal distribution for all the parameters are
approximately normal.
   Finally, in this application we also considered normal bivariate prior distri-
butions for the mean parameter Œ≤ = (Œ≤0 , Œ≤1 ) and for the variance parameters
Œ≥ = (Œ≥0 , Œ≥1 ).

   In this model, given the error structure, ri = Œ∑0i + Œ∑1i ti + i , there is a

    In all cases, the obtained mean parameter estimates given by the two models
agree. However, there are considerable differences in BIC values (Bayes Informa-
tion Criterion) used for discrimination of models (Table 2). From the result in
Table 2, we conclude that the model with joint modeling of the mean and variance
heterogeneity is the best, since its BIC value is the smallest one.

4.2. Growth and Development of Population
   In this section, we apply a Bayesian analysis to the growth and body devel-
opment considering a sample of Bogota‚Äôs individuals. We consider tallness as a
response variable of interest to specify an appropriate dependence on age and
socioeconomic level as possible factors associated with growing and body develop-
mental processes (Adair et al. 2005).
    The tallness of 311 person was measured and the age and socioeconomic stra-
tum recorded. The individuals in the sample aged from 6 months to 20 years old
and the socioeconomic strata were lower, medium and high, with approximately
100 individuals in each stratum. The data set shows some interesting character-
istics exhibited in Figure 4: (a) the mean height increases in time but it does
not have a linear behavior. (b) the means of tallness have a socioeconomic level
dependence. (c) the sample variances are not homogeneous, increasing with the
time and it seems to be different for each socioeconomic level.


4.2.1. A general approximation applying model 1

  Taking into account these last points, we initially considered cubic polynomial
models for the mean and variance. After a variable elimination process,
                                                                       a quadratic

These mean and variance models were fitted with vague priors distributions for
each parameters. We further assumed prior independence among the parameters.
The posterior means and standard deviations for the parameters model are given

    From Figure 4, we can establish some features of the growing process of this
group of Bogota‚Äôs individuals. We also can compare the fitted model with the
existing mean international curves for human growing and developing. We observe
for this data set, the mean height curve is lower than the standard curve for human
growth at all times, that is, there is some evidence of problems in the growth and
body developing process. The differences could be an indication of malnutrition
for some members of this group, an opinion that is shared by pediatricians and
nutritional specialists.

4.2.2. General Approximation Using Normal Regression with Random
       Variables

                                                                        2

   For this data

i ‚àº N 0, œÉe . In this model, Yi is the tallness of the i-th individual at age ti .
Variation in the mean regression parameters is written in the second level as

                                        Œ≤0i = Œ≤0 + Œ∑0i
                                        Œ≤1i = Œ≤1 + Œ∑1i
                                        Œ≤2i = Œ≤2 + Œ∑2i

where Œ∑ki ‚àº N (0, œÉk2 ), k=0,1,2. To complete the model, conjugate Gamma(0.00
019, 0.0001) prior distributions are assumed for the hyperparameters. Thus, the
hierarchical model is given by

                    Yi = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1 ti + Œ≤2 t2i + Œ∑0i + Œ∑1i ti + Œ∑2i t2i + i                          (8)


    In this model, given the error structure, ri = Œ∑0i + Œ∑1i ti + Œ∑2i t2i + i , there
is a heteroscedastic structure of the variance conditional on the level of the ex-
planatory variable t. As in the last application, we assume independence between
observations, that is,

  V ar(ri ) = œÉ02 + œÉ12 t2i + œÉ22 t4i + 2œÉ01 ti + 2œÉ02 t2i + 2œÉ12 t3i + œÉe2 ,     i = 1, 2, . . . , n

where œÉi,i0 = Cov(Œ∑i , Œ∑i0 ), and œÉe2 = V ar(i ).
    The posterior means and standard deviations for the parameters models are:
Œ≤b0 = 56.020(1.747), Œ≤b1 = 8.491(0.440), Œ≤b2 = ‚àí0.168(0.023). The Bayesian esti-

    As in the last example, we can see the Monte Carlo estimates for the pos-
terior means for the parameters of interest assuming the two models agree. We
also observe that there are considerable differences in the BIC values for the two
models (Table 4). From the results of Table 4 we conclude that the model with
joint modeling for the variance heterogeneity is better fitted by the data than the
hierarchical model, since its BIC value is the smallest in comparison with the BIC
value for the hierarchical model.

5. Growth and Development by Socioeconomic
   Stratum
    In this section, we consider a second analysis for the tallness data. Here we are
interested in determining if there are significant differences in the growing process
depending on the socioeconomic levels, which are associated with nutritional status
of the individuals, with a direct influence on their growing process.


5.1. Applying Model 1
   In this analysis we considered indicator variables Ii , i = 1, 2, 3, for lower,
medium and high socioeconomic stratum, respectively, and interaction variables
Xi = Ii t, obtained by the product of t and Ii . Thus, taking into account the last
description of the data, we propose the following model

    In the estimation process I3 was eliminated from the model for the mean,
and I3 , X12 , X22 and X32 from the model for the variance. With this new model,
we obtain Monte Carlo estimates for the parameters in the model also assuming

socioeconomic strata. People from medium socioeconomic stratum show a signif-
icantly lower tallness than people from high socioeconomic stratum, considering
different ages. This fact is easy to understand, since in this case socioeconomic sta-
tus has a special relevance on nutrition of people, and people from lower stratum
probably have nutritional deficiencies (see Stein et al. 2004).
   From the variance model, it can be seen that in the lower socioeconomic stra-
                                       bi2 = 3.314 + 0.092Xi. In the other strata,
tum, the variance behavior is given by œÉ
the variance is constant through time, œÉ bi = 4.412. This behavior is shown in
Figure 6.
    This is a worrisome situation, since official reports from the Economic Commis-
sion for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) show the situation of poverty
and indigence for Colombian children and teenagers: 45% can be considered poor
and 17% indigents. If we add these numbers we obtain 62% of Colombians who
do not have high life expectancy and whose nutritional supplies are not the proper
ones, which results in a lack of optimal level of physical development.

   In this section, the effect of socioeconomic stratum in the nutritional devel-
opment of the people is evaluated through the tallness of the individuals. In our
application, we have N individual belonging to low, medium and high socioeco-

nomic strata. The tallness and the age of each individual were determined and
denoted Yij and tij , respectively, where the subscript ij indicate that the mea-
sures belong to the i-th individual belonging to j-th strata. Thus, as it is usual in
multilevel analysis, in the first level, individuals are considered and a regression
model (9) is defined for each group.
                                                                        

    In this model, Œ≤j = (Œ≤0j , Œ≤1j , Œ≤2j ) is the parameter vector associated to the j-th
stratum, j = 1, 2, 3, and ij is the random error associated in the i-th subject. In
the second level of the model, the regression coefficient Œ≤i is explained by predicted
variables Z, through the model

   In Figure 7, we have the plot of the mean tallness against time for each one of
the assumed stratum.We can see an agreement between average tallness behaviour
showed in this figure and the behaviour showed in Figure 5, where the analysis was
conducted using joint modelling of the mean and variance heterogeneity. In this
example, we further observe considerable differences in the BIC values considering
the different models as we can see in Table 8. From the results of this table, we
again conclude that the model with joint modeling of the mean and of the variance
heterogeneity is better fitted by the data than the hierarchical model.

6. Concluding Remarks
     From this comparative study for the two proposed models, we conclude that it
is better to jointly model the mean and variance heterogeneity, as observed in all
examples, in comparison to the use of hierarchical models. Additionally, conver-
gence of the chain used to simulate samples for the posterior distribution of interest
is quickly achieved and the model is easily interpretable. The proposed analysis
can be convenient in social applications since these models perfectly capture any
clustering by subgroups that may exist in the data. Other good reason for the
modelling of the variance heterogeneity is related to the use of the explanatory
variables in the regression model, since we can use the same explanatory variables
assumed for the regression model for the mean or other different variables, for
each one of the assumed groups. That is, this analysis also takes into consider-
ation one of the most important goals of the multilevel statistical analysis, that
is, it ‚Äúsubstantively take into account for causal heterogeneity‚Äù. Although there is
no statistical differences between intercepts in the growing curves for medium and
hight strata, apparently there is an advantage for hight strata through time. We
also observe that the joint modeling of mean and variance heterogeneity is simpler
and easier to interpret.

function for Œ∏. For simplicity, we assume independence between parameters, and
assign the following prior distributions:

where co , do , c1 , d1 , e00 , e01 , e10 , e11 are known constants.
