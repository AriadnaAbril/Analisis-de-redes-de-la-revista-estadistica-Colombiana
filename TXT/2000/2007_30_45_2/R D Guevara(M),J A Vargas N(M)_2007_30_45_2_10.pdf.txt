Comparison of Process Capability Indices under Autocorrelated Data
Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Ambientales;Universidad Nacional de Colombia
Abstract
The process capability indices provide a measure of how a process fits within the specification limits. In calculating indices is usual to assume that the process data are independent. However, in industrial applications data are often autocorrelated. This paper deals with the indices Cp , Cpk , Cpm and Cpmk when data are autocorrelated. Variances for their estimators are derived and coverage probabilities of some confidence intervals are calculated.
Key words: Autocorrelation, Process analysis, Estimation, Process capability indices, SPC.
Introduction
Process capability analysis is an important tool, widely used in industrial quality improvement programs. A basic assumption in process capability analysis is that process data are independent and identically normally distributed. However, in several industrial processes, data exhibit some degree of autocorrelation. Though the literature on process capability indices is voluminous, there is not significant research when data are autocorrelated, as can be observed in Kotz & Johnson (2002) and in Spiring et al. (2003). Zhang (1998) studied the indices Cp and Cpk for autocorrelated data. We extend Zhang’s study to the capability indices Cpm and Cpmk and compare the four indices Cp , Cpk , Cpm and Cpmk for stationary gaussian processes. Additionally, some results have been taken from Guevara (2005) in his master’s thesis. In the first part of this article we introduce the definition of the capability indices Cp , Cpk , Cpm and Cpmk . Subsequently, we present: 1) some relevant terminology about stationary gaussian processes, and 2) the expected values and variances of X, S 2 and S in these processes. In Section 4, we calculate the variances of the estimators of Cpm and Cpmk , in stationary gaussian processes. Section 5, shows why the autocorrelation structure of process data, when it is present, should not be ignored for calculating any of the four indices. This is carried out through a simulation study with AR(1) processes. In
Section 6, inferential procedures are performed, by measuring the coverage prob-
ability of confidence intervals constructed for some of the indices studied. Finally,
some conclusions are given.



2. Process Capability Indices
    Among the several capability indices defined in the literature, the most exten-
sively used in the industry are Cp , Cpk , Cpm and Cpmk , defined as follows:

                                       U SL − LSL
                                Cp =
                                           6σ

where U SL and LSL are the upper and lower specification limits respectively and
σ is the process standard deviation.

where µ is the process mean, a = (U SL − LSL)/2, b = (U SL + LSL)/2,
d = U SL − LSL and m = (U SL + LSL).

3. Stationary Gaussian Processes
   If {Xt } is a process such that V ar(Xt ) < ∞ for each t ∈ W ⊂ R, where R is
the set of real numbers, then the autocovariance function γX (·, ·) of {Xt } is:
                                                            
        γX (r, s) = Cov(Xr , Xs ) = E (Xr − EXr )(Xs − EXs ) , r, s ∈ W

    The time series {Xt , t ∈ Z}, with index set Z, is said to be stationary if
E|Xt |2 < ∞, ∀t ∈ Z, E(Xt ) = m, ∀t ∈ Z and γX (r, s) = γX (r + t, s + t),
∀r, s, t ∈ Z; therefore µX(t) is independent of t, and γX (t + h, t) is independent of
t for each h ∈ Z.
     If {Xt } is a stationary process, the autocovariance function (ACVF) of {Xt }
is
                                γX (h) = Cov(Xt+h , Xt )
and the autocorrelation function (ACF) is given by

                                       γX (h)
                            ρX (h) =          = Cor(Xt+h , Xt )
                                       γX (0)

(see Brockwell & Davis 1996).
   {Xt } is a process gaussian if all of its joint distributions are multivariate nor-
mal. A process is said to be stationary gaussian if it is stationary and gaussian
simultaneously (see Brockwell & Davis 1996).
    Let {Xt } be a stationary gaussian process. Let {X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn } be a sample   
                                                                           Pn

of size n from the process {Xt }. Let X = i=1 n , and S =                       n−1
be the sample mean and the sample variance respectively. Zhang (1998) gives the
expected values and variances of X, S 2 and S:

These last two results are equal to those found by Bissel (1990).
   To compare the variances of these estimators, a simulation study was carried
out for a first order stationary autorregressive process with parameter φ. For
Cp = 1.33, ξ = 0, 5, 10, φ = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and n = 10, 20, . . . , 200, Figure 1 shows
                               
great variability of V ar Cbpm for n < 100. Fixing Cp , n and ξ as |φ| increases,
                                                                          
V ar Cbpm increases. Similar results are obtained for V ar C         bpmk , substituting
Cpm for Cpmk and Cp for Cpk as can be seen in Figure 2. Now, if φ and ξ are fixed
                                                     
values and n increases, V ar C bpm and V ar C    bpmk decreases. For fixed values of
φ and n, when ξ increases,
                            this is, the target value is far away from the mean of
the process, V ar Cbpm and V ar C   bpmk decreases.



5. Autocorrelation Effects on Process Capability
   Indices
    We consider the example given in Shore (1997). A quality characteristic is
normally distributed with mean 40 and standard deviation 7. The specification
limits are U SL = 61 and LSL = 19. Different target values are considered: 40,
41, 42, 45 and 50. We then compare two processes. A process with independent
observations and a process with observations following an AR(1) model, Xt =
Xt−1 + et , where {et } is a series of uncorrelated errors, et ∼ N (0, σe2 ) and σe = 7.
For each process, the mean, the standard deviation and the capability indices Cp ,
Cpk , Cpm and Cpmk are calculated. We do not show the values of Cpk and Cpmk
because Cp = Cpk and Cpm = Cpmk see Table 1.
   We observe in Table 1 that the higher the autocorrelation level the lower the
capability index value.

Table 1: Mean, standard deviation (STD), Cp and Cpm of a process not autocorrelated
         vs. a process following an AR(1) model.

   Through a simulation study we analyze the effect of the autocorrelation in the
expected value of the sample mean and in the expected value of the standard error.
We generated 1000 samples from a no autocorrelated model and 1000 samples from
an AR(1) model for each of the following cases: n = 15, 50, 100, 200; T = 40, 41,
Table 2 shows partial
results of these simulations.

Table 2: Expected values and standard errors of the sample mean and sample standard
         deviation for processes no autocorrelated and processes following an AR(1)
         model.

    Table 2 shows that the autocorrelation does not affect the expected value of
the sample mean while a different situation occurs with the expected value of the
                                                    σe2          2
standard error. Let us remember that V ar(Xt ) = 1−φ    2 where σe is the white noise

variance. For example, for n = 15 and φ = −0.25 the estimated expected value
of the standard error is 7.13 in autocorrelated processes, for φ = −0.5 is 7.95 and
for φ = −0.75 is 10.38. For independent observations the values are 6.88, 6.85 and

                                       Revista Colombiana de Estadística 30 (2007) 301–316

310                                      Rubén Darío Guevara & José Alberto Vargas

6.88 respectively. As n increases, the estimated expected value of the standard
error increases slightly for autocorrelated data. For example, for φ = 0.25 the
estimated expected values for n = 15, 50, 100 are 7.05, 7.18 and 7.23 respectively.
    Through other simulation study we analyze the performance of the capability
indices estimators. Comparing the estimated expected values of the capability
indices estimators shown in Table 3 with the theoretical values shown in Table
1, it can be observed that for autocorrelated processes the estimators are slightly
biased, bias that decreases as n increases. For example, for φ = −0.75 and n = 15,
50, 100 the expected values of Cbp are 0.703, 0.673 and 0.668 respectively, while the
true value is 0.661. For φ = 0.25 and n = 15, 50 y 100 the expected values of C   bpk
are 0.937, 0.935 and 0.938 while the true value is 0.968. For n = 15 and φ = 0.50,
the expected values of Cbpm are 0.84, 0.84, 0.83 and 0.81 when µ − T = 0, 1, 2 and
3 respectively, while the true values are 0.866, 0.859, 0.841 and 0.812.


6. Confidence Intervals for the Capability Indices
   under Stationary Gaussian Processes
     Let us assume that µ = 50, U SL = 3 and LSL = −3. For sample sizes n = 25,
50, 100 and standard deviation values σ = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, AR(1) processes with
normally distributed white noise are generated with φ = −0.75, −0.50, −0.25,
0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. For each combination of n, φ and σ, 5000 random samples
from a normal distribution were generated. For each sample, the values of X, S,
C     bpk , C
 bp , C     bpm , C
                  bpmk , σ     bcpk , σ
                         bcp , σ               bcpmk are obtained. We calculated the
                                      bcpm and σ
proportion of times that the true index is contained in the interval

                            \index ± k(b
                       capability      σcapability index )

   The simulations showed a coverage probability for Cp of about 95% for k = 2
and 99% for k = 3 . For Cpk the coverage probability was of around 90% for k = 2.
Tables 4 and 5 show the coverage probabilities of the intervals for Cp and Cpk .
The coverage probabilities for Cpm and Cpmk are not shown here because these
were very low.
    In Tables 4 and 5 we observe that as n increases, the coverage probabilities
increase. In Table 5 it can be observed that coverage percentage for Cpk decreases
when σ increases, being more evident for large values of φ. We observe that for
φ = −0.75 the coverage probabilities are very similar for different values of σ.
    We also calculate through simulations the coverage probabilities of the con-
fidence interval for Cpm , proposed by Boyles (1991). This interval is defined as
follows:                   r                r
                                    .                 . 

for Cpmk for different values of k1 and k2 . Table 6 presents some limited values
of k1 and k2 , which offer a coverage between 74% and 85% for the index Cpm for
n = 50, φ = 0.50, σ = 1.5 and |µ − T | = 5 when 2 ≤ k1 ≤ 3 and 2 ≤ k2 ≤ 3. This
coverage is greater or equal than 90% for k1 ≥ 2.7 and k2 ≥ 3.7. We did not find
reliable results for Cpmk , this is, the coverage probabilities obtained are low, for
example the coverage is between 33% and 48% for n = 50, φ = 0.50, σ = 1.5 and
|µ − T | = 5 when 2 ≤ k1 ≤ 3 and 2 ≤ k2 ≤ 3, see Table 7. We believe that the low
coverage probabilities are due to the bias of the estimators.

7. Conclusions
    We found approximations of the variances of C    bpm and C bpmk for stationary
gaussian processes. In particular, we show expressions for the variance of these
estimators when the observations are independent, for µ = T and µ 6= T .
    Through a simulation study, we show that the higher the autocorrelation level
the lower the capability index value. We also observed that for autocorrelated
processes the estimators are slightly biased, bias that decreases as n increases.
    The autocorrelation does not affect the expected value of the sample mean of
the capability indices estimators but affect the estimated expected value of the
standard error, that increases slightly for autocorrelated data when n increases.
