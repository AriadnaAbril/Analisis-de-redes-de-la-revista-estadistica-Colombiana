Central Limit Theorems for S-Gini and Theil Inequality Coefficients
Fundación Caubet-Cimera Illes Balears
Abstract
The Hungarian Construction (Komlós et al. 1975) is used for getting a proof of asymptotic normality of S-Gini coefficient; this method is very interesting because it can be used to check asymptotic normality of other income inequality measures as Theil coefficient. Besides, explicit expressions of asymptotic means and variances are given for S-Gini and Theil estimators. Finally, to illustrate the performance of obtained results, we carry out a simulation study comparing the asymptotic and Smoothed Bootstrap approximations.
Key words: S-Gini index, Theil index, Hungarian construction, Kernel density estimation.
Introduction
The Gini Concentration Index (Gini 1995) has been extensively used in the study of distribution inequality. If L is the Lorenz function it is defined as:
or, for certain random sample x1 , . . . , xN and, if x(1) , . . . , x(N ) are the sorted sam-
ple:
                                      XN
                                            (2i − N )x(i)
                              G=                PN
                                      i=1 N       i=1 xi

    In the general case, the variable in study is defined on the real interval (m, M )
with 0 ≤ m < M < ∞ (we always assume this condition), an equivalent expression
for the Gini index used in Giles (2004) is

This index has been very actively investigated for the last three decades. Its
exact sample distribution in the particular case of a skew normal distribution has
been studied by Crocetta & Loperfido (2005) under a more general case of the
L-statistics. In the general case, its asymptotic distribution and the asymptotic
distribution of other families which generalizes the Gini Index (E-Gini) have been
studied by Zitikis (2003) and Martínez-Camblor (2005). The multivariate case has
been studied by Martínez-Camblor (2007).
   Donalson & Weymark (1980, 1983) and Yitzhaki (1983) propose the Single
Parameter Gini (S-Gini) define as:
                   Z
 SGk =1 − k(k − 1) (1 − p)k−2 L(p) dp

       µ

for k = 2 we obtain the Gini standard coefficient.
    In section 2 we derive the asymptotic normality of G  b n and using the same
technique, we also get to prove the asymptotic distribution for S-Gini and Theil
Coefficients (Theil 1967).
    With a plug-in method, the main results are adapted to be used in practice. We
replace both unknown expected value and variance for theirs respective smoothed

for the Smoothed Empirical Distribution Function (SEDF) defined by Nadaraya
(1964) as:

    Section 3 is devoted to propose a resample method for G
more useful technique is the Smoothed Bootstrap (Hall et al. 1989), we describe
it in this concrete case.
   Finally and in order to study the performance of two proposed methods, we
show the obtained results in simulation work.


2. Main Results and Proofs
    In this section we prove the main results of this paper. To derive them, we
will be based on theorem 3 of Komlós et al. (1975) which imply that there exists
a probabilisty space (Ω, σ, P) and a Brownian Bridge, W0 , such that

     √                               log n
      n Fn (x) − F (x) = W0 {F (x)} + √ Zn (x),             a.s. (almost surely)
                                         n

where Zn (x) is an random variable almost surely bounded.
   A Brownian Bridge is a gaussians process with expected value, E(W0 {t}2 ) =
t(1−t) and E(W0 {t}W0 {s}) = s(1−t) for s ≤ t (see, for example Billingsley 1968).

Theorem 1. Let (x1 , . . . , xn ) a random sample from F , then

from the equality; Fn (x) = F (x) + OP (n−1/2 ), and the Theorem 3 of Komlós et al.
(1975) we have that

applying the integration by parts,
       Z
  ξn = (1 − 2F (x) + G)W0 {F (x)} dx + OP (n−1/2 ) = ξ + OP (n−1/2 )            a.s.

Now, F is vanish out of (m, M ) so, we know that there exists θ ∈ (m, M ) such
that
     Z
  ξ = (1 − 2F (x) + G)W0 {F (x)} dx = (M − m)(1 − 2F (θ) + G)W0 {F (θ)} (6)

has a normal distribution with mean zero and variance,

        =    (1 − 2F (x) + G)(1 − 2F (y) + G)E W0 {F (x)}W0 {F (y)} dx dy

and from basic properties of Brownian Bridge we obtain the final expression for
the variance

                                                                

             u

On the other hand, X = µ + OP (n−1/2 ), so we have that

               V         XV    µ + OP n−1/2 V        µV

since ξ has a N(0, µV) distribution, the proof is completed.

   This technique can be applied to prove the asymptotic normality of other
similar rates. For instance, if we considere the natural estimator of SGk ,
                                    Z                                     

we will derive the following result,

Theorem 2. Let (x1 , . . . , xn ) a random sample from F then

Newly, we apply the Hungarian Construction to obtain that a Brownian Bridge,
W0 , exists such that we have the equality

and from a Brownian Bridge properties and proceeding as in (6) we have that
there exists θ ∈ (m, M ) such that

so, ∆k is normal distributed with mean zero and variance

the result (8) is immediately deduced applying a similar reasoning to the one used
in (7).

    Theorem 2 is more general than Theorem 1, of course, expressions in (8) and
(9) are generalizations of expressions in (3) and (5) and they are the sames for
k = 2.
    Following, we will apply the previous method to derive the asymptotic norma-
lity for Theil Coefficient (Theil 1967) defined as:
         Z M                                               Z M                !
    1                    y           1               M                 y
T =               y log     dF (y) =     M log               −     log   + 1 F (y) dy

the usual way to estimate the Theil coefficient is to consider the estimator
                                            n                    
                                       1 X                   xi
                                Tbn =        xi log
                                      nX i=1                 X

     Applying the previosly technique we will prove the result

Theorem 3. Let (x1 , . . . , xn ) a random sample from F then

   Using one-term Taylor expansion for the logarithmic function in a neighbor-
hood of one, we have
                                             
        √          µ       √             µ−X         √ µ−X                 
          n log          =   n log 1 +            = n           + OP n−1/2    (10)
                  X                        X               X
                                                                        
From the equalities X = µ + OP n−1/2 and Fn (u) = F (u) + OP n−1/2 and (10)
we can obtain the equality

and applying the Hungarian Construction we know that a Brownian Bridge, W0 ,
exists such that

then, from Integral Mean Value Theorem, for θ ∈ (m, M ) we have the equality

and η is normal distribution with mean zero and variance

   In practice, previous theorems can not be used because it is impossible to
compute neither the expected value nor variance. In proposition 2.1 of Martínez-
Camblor (2006) is proved that if there exists real values 0 ≤ m < M < ∞ such
that F (m) = 0 and F (M ) = 1 (this assumption is assumed always in this work);
F has three bounded and continuous derivatives; the kernel function used in (2),
K, has bounded variation; its support is contained in a compact set; and the
parameter hn satisfies that

All these parameters are easily computed. Expressions (11) and (12) can be used to
make confidence intervals and to make inferences from a real data set. Obviously,
it is straightforward to apply the same method to build confidences intervals for
SGk .


3. Smoothed Bootstrap
   In this section we propose a resample method to compute the mean and vari-
ance of the studied estimators. When we are assuming that the distribution is
continuous the more efficient resample technique is the Smooth Bootstrap. This
method is studied, for example, for Hall et al. (1989) or González Manteiga et al.
(1994) and if we had a sample of size n this would be its basic procedure:

  1. We compute the SEDF, Fen , from the data.

                                                                    bn for

  3. We approximate the real distribution of G
     previous B computed.

For that estimators, the consistence of the previous method is proved straightfor-
ward. For example, for GCI, let (xB              B                           e
Gn the Gini coefficient of F , we have the convergence

The same process can be applied without wrinkles to Theil and S-Gini coefficients.


4. Simulations
    Finally, we describe the performance of both proposed methods in three dif-
ferent distributions and for different sample sizes. In each case we carry out a
thousand Monte Carlo (Metropolis & Ulam 1949) samples and we compute confi-
dence intervals for Gini index using the asymptotic distribution given in (3) and
when we estimate the mean and variance from the Smoothed Bootstrap method.
For this work we have used the software R (R Development Core Team 2006).
    In the first situation, we consider a Weibull distribution with parameters three
and two. Its real Gini coefficient value is 0.2063 and the standard deviation of
Gini estimator (value of the parameter defined in (5)) is V = 0.1490.
    In table 1 we can be see as both the Gini coefficient and the standard deviation
are well approximated but a little overestimate and the asymptotic approximation
for intervals works always better than bootstrap percentiles although the coverage
probability is lower than the nominal 1 − α level. On the other hand, for sample
sizes n ≥ 100, the coverage probability of asymptotic intervals are quite similar.
    In the second case (table 2), the distribution considered is Logarithmic Normal
with parameters zero and one. The values of the Gini and its deviation V are
0.5205 and 0.4271 respectively.
    As in the first case, the approximations for the Gini coefficient and its standard
deviation are quite good; but there is to much intervals that exclude the real value
                       Table 1: Percentage of miscoverage in tails.
of the Gini in the left side when we used the bootstrap method and in the right
side when asymptotic distribution is used. The obtained percentage is near to the
expected one only for n = 500 and we used the asymptotic approximation.

                       Table 2: Percentage of miscoverage in tails.

    Finally, in the thrird case, we consider the incomes of 5426 Spanish families
in 1998 (this data set are from the European Community Household Panel) and
we suppose that its Smoothed Empirical Distribution Function (SEDF) is the real
distribution function (the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Smoothed
Empirical Distribution Function (SEDF) appear in figure 1). The mean of families
incomes is 10298.8 euros with a standard deviation of 7298.82. The Gini index is
0.3531 and the standard deviation of its estimator is 0.2682.
   In the table 3 we can see that the V estimations are good but both, asymptotic
and bootstrap approximations, have a too high number of intervals which don’t
contain the real value of the parameter and the convergence is slow.
   In general the obtained results are the usual in these kind of studies. We obtain
quite good fitted for not especially big sample sizes and, of course, with smaller
sample sizes than the usual ones in this type of studies.

5. Conclusions
   In this paper, we have not only develop a method for proving the asymptotic
normality of Gini, S-Gini and Theil estimators, but we also give speed convergence
bounders.
    The same method of proof is easily applicable to other indices; for instance it
is straightforward to obtain the asymptotic normality of the E-Gini (Chakravarty
1988), a family of coefficients defined to each δ ≥ 1 as:

where L(p) is the Lorenz function.
   On the other hand, we have obtained explicit expressions for asymptotic means
and variances which are easily estimated and resampling plan has been proposed.
Simulations show that asymptotic approximation intervals are always better than
bootstrap intervals although the coverage probability is always lower than the
nominal 1 − α level.
