Abstract
In this paper we consider Bayesian estimation based on bivariate ranked set sample, in which units are ranked based on measurements made on an easily and exactly measurable auxiliary variable X which is correlated with the study variable Y . We obtain Bayes estimator for the scale parameter of the study variate Y , when (X, Y ) follows a Morgenstern type bivariate Rayleigh distribution. The Bayes estimators are considered based on bivariate ranked set sampling, extreme ranked set sampling and maximum ranked set sampling with unequal sample. The accuracy of estimation methods in this paper is illustrated using simulation study. Finally, a real data set is analyzed.

1. Introduction

    Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) distribution is a class of bivariate
distributions that rst introduced by Morgenstern (1956) and extended it to
the multivariate case by Farlie (1960). Some authors studied on FGM class of
distribution in literature: For example Bivariate logistic distributions by Gumbel
(1960b), Morgenstern type bivariate gamma distribution by D'Este (1981) and
Tahmasebi & Jafari (2015a), uniform distribution by Bairamov & Bekci (1999),
Tahmasebi & Jafari (2017) and Singh & Mehta.V (2015), exponential distribution
by Gumbel (1960a), Balasubramanian & Beg (1997) and Chacko & Thomas (2011),
generalized exponential distribution by Tahmasebi & Jafari (2014) and Tahmasebi
& Jafari (2015b).
   Let the n pairs (Xi , Yi ) be a random sample from a bivariate distribution
with cdf F (x, y). If the (Xi , Yi ) are ordered by X -variates (in increasing order of
magnitude), then the Y values associated with the Xr:n , 1 ≤ r ≤ n of X (denoted
as Y[r:n] ) is called the concomitant of the rth order statistics.
   The paired (X, Y ) is said to be a bivariate FGM distributed if the bivariate
cumulative distribution function (cdf) F (x, y) is an absolutely continuous such
that:

       FX,Y (x, y) = FX (x)FY (y)[1 + α(1 − FX (x))(1 − FY (y))],                   −1 ≤ α ≤ 1.

The corresponding pdf is given by:

      fX,Y (x, y) = fX (x)fY (y)[1 + α(1 − 2FX (x))(1 − 2FY (y))],                  −1 ≤ α ≤ 1.

Therefore, the conditional cumulative distribution function (cdf) and pdf of Y
given X = x are obtained by:

                 FY |X (y|x) = FY (y)[1 + α(1 − 2FX (x))(1 − FY (y))],

and
                 fY |X (y|x) = fY (y)[1 + α(1 − 2FX (x))(1 − 2FY (y))],
respectively.

are considered by Tahmasebi, Eskandarzadeh & Almaspoor (2017) to obtain
unbiased estimator and BLUE of parameter σ2 using ranked set sampling (RSS).
This sampling technique proposed by McIntyre (1952) and has studied in dierent
areas that actual measurements of the variable of study are time consuming or
expensive. The RSS is an alternative to simple random sampling (SRS) that can
be used to improve the cost eciency and precision.
   In order to obtain a ranked set sample of size n from the population, we draw
n independent sets, each is based on a simple random sample of size n from the
population and order each set by visual judgment (without actual measurement).
Then the rth observation of rth set is measured.
    Estimation of some distribution parameters based on RSS are considered in
literature for example: location-scale family of distribution by Stokes (1995),
two-parameter exponential distribution by Lam et al. (1994), bivariate normal
distribution by Al-Saleh & Al-Ananbeh (2005) and Al-Saleh & Al-Ananbeh (2007),
Morgenstern type bivariate exponential distribution by Chacko & Thomas (2008),
Downton's bivariate exponential distribution by Al-Saleh & Diab (2009), and
Morgenstern type bivariate gamma distribution by Tahmasebi & Jafari (2015b).
    A modied of ranked set sampling procedure called extreme ranked set
sampling (ERSS) in which only the largest or the smallest judgment ranked unit
of each set is chosen for quantication introduced by Stokes (1980) and applied by
Samawi et al. (1996). Comparison of Bayesian estimation based on RSS and ERSS
from Morgenstern type bivariate exponential distribution considered by Chacko
(2017). Eskandarzadeh et al. (2018), considered measures of information for an
another modication of RSS called maximum ranked set sampling with unequal
samples (MRSSU). In this method n sets via SRS are taken from the population
such that the size of ith set is i, and the maximum of each set is measured.
    The organization of this article is as follows. In Section 2, dierent Bayes
estimators for σ2 when the association parameter α is known in MTBRD are
obtained by using bivariate RSS, ERSS and MRSSU methods, respectively. We
consider the Bayesian estimation of σ2 based on the above methods when α is
unknown in Section 3. Also, the eciency of all estimators are evaluated by
simulation study in Section 4. In addition, a data set have been analyzed for
illustrative purposes in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in 6.
   We also consider the square-root inverted-gamma (S.R.IGamma) prior for σ2
which has the form

                                    ab                 − a2
                 π(σ2 |a, b) =         b−1
                                           (σ2 )−2b−1 e 2σ2 ,   σ2 > 0,                (1)
                                 Γ(b)2
where a > 0 and b > 0. Also, E(σ2 ) = (a/2)1/2 Γ(b−1/2)
                                                     Γ(b) . When a = b = 0, (1)
be the non-informative prior of σ2 . This prior pdf was rst proposed by Bernardo
(1994).

2. Bayesian estimation of                                 σ2 when α is known
   In this Section, we obtain dierent Bayes estimators of σ2 when the association
parameter α is known in MTBRD by using bivariate RSS and some its
modications.


2.1. Bayesian estimation based on bivariate RSS

    RSS is useful in cases where measuring the main variable Y is much more
dicult than to ranking. However, even if ranking of the interest variable Y is
dicult, but there is an easily ranked axillary variable X as the ranking criterion
available, then it may be used to judgment ranking the study variable Y . This
sampling method is called bivariate RSS and introduced by Stokes (1977) as
follows:
Step 1. Draw n independent sets, each is based on a simple random bivariate
sample of size n from the population (X, Y ).
Step 2. Rank the units within each sample with respect to an axillary variable
X together with the associated variable Y .
Step 3. Measure the rth observation of the rth set (X(r)r , Y[r]r ), r = 1, 2, . . . , n,
where X(r)r is the rth order statistics of the rth sample and Y[r]r is the
corresponding measurement made on the study variable Y of the same unit.
      The pdf and cdf of X(r)r , denoted by fr:n (x) and Fr:n (x) and are given by

                           n!                r−1         n−r
       fr:n (x) =                     [F (x)] [1 − F (x)]    f (x),             −∞ < x < ∞,
                    (r − 1)! (n − r)!
and

              Fr:n (x) =                   [F (x)] [1 − F (x)]        ,   −∞ < x < ∞,

respectively.

2.2. Bayesian Estimation Based on Bivariate Upper Extreme
         RSS

    We can provided a ranked set sample of size n by each sample measurement
of Y which is taken on the unit that has the maximum value for the X variable.
Let Y[n]r be concomitant of largest order statistics X(n)r of the rth sample for
r = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then, Y[n]1 , Y[n]2 , . . . , Y[n]n are the observations of the interest
variable Y based on bivariate upper extreme ranked set sample (ERSS). In other
words, the procedure of bivariate ERSS is as follows:
Step 1. Draw n independent sets, each is based on a simple random bivariate
sample of size n from the population (X, Y ).
Step 2. Rank the units within each sample with respect to an auxiliary variable
X together with the associated variable Y .
Step 3. Measure the nth observation of the rth set (X(n)r , Y[n]r ), r = 1, 2, . . . , n,
where X(n)r is the largest order statistics of the rth sample and Y[n]r is the
concomitant of X(n)r .
   From (4), the mean and variance of Y[n]r are given as E(Y[n]r ) = σ2 βn and
V ar[Y[n]r ] = σ22 λn , respectively. Also, for 1 ≤ r < s ≤ n, Cov[Y[n]r , Y[n]s ] = 0.

2.3. Bayesian Estimation Based on Bivariate MRSSU

   In the previous methods, one chooses n2 independent bivariate units, arranges
                                                                          n
them randomly into n sets with equal size, but in this method selecting
                                                                         P
                                                                            r=
                                                                          r=1
n(n+1)
   2   , independent bivariate units, arrange them randomly into n sets such that
the size of rth set is r.
   The procedure of MRSSU for bivariate (X, Y ), where X is an auxiliary variable
and Y the study variable is as follows:
Step 1. Draw n independent sets, each is based on a simple random bivariate
sample, such that the size of rth set is r.
Step 2. Rank the units within each sample with respect to an auxiliary variable
X together with the associated variable Y .
Step 3. In the rth sample of size r, select the unit (Xr:r , Y[r]:r ), r = 1, 2, . . . , n,
where Xr:r is the maximum of the rth sample and Y[r]:r be concomitant of the
largest order statistics Xr:r .
      Also, the following procedure can represent bivariate MRSSU:
      (X1:1 , Y[1]:1 )
                                                                        → (X1:1 , Y[1]:1 )
      (X1:2 , Y[1]:2 )   (X2:2 , Y[2]:2 )                               → (X2:2 , Y[2]:2 )
             ..                 ..          ..               ..                  ..
              .                  .           .                .         →         .
      (X1:n , Y[1]:n )   (X2:n , Y[2]:n ) · · ·       (Xn:n , Y[n]:n   )→(Xn:n , Y[n]:n )

   As mentioned earlier, Xr:r , s are independent and non-identically distributed
(INID). The pdf and cdf of Xr:r , s are derived as follows:
                                                           r−1
                          fr:r (x) = rf (x)[F (x)]               ,   −∞ < x < ∞,

and
                                                       r
                                Fr:r (x) = [F (x)] ,         −∞ < x < ∞,
respectively. Y[1]:1 , Y[2]:2 , . . . , Y[n]:n be the observations of the concomitant variable
Y based on bivariate MRSSU. From (2) and (3) the cdf and pdf of Y[r]:r , r =
1, 2, . . . , n are given by

3. Bayesian Estimation of                                             σ2 when α is Unknown
   In this Section, we consider Bayesian estimation of σ2 based on bivariate RSS,
ERSS and MRSSU when the association parameter α is unknown. Since α lies
between -1 and 1 we assume a U nif orm(−1, 1) prior for α and the pdf prior of
σ2 is given by (1), independent of α. Using the joint pdf function given in (2.1),
(10), (13) and (based on RSS, ERSS and MRSSU respectively) and the joint prior
densities of σ2 and α, we obtain the joint pdf of (data, σ2 , α) as follows
                                         f (data|σ2 , α) × π1 (σ2 ) × π2 (α).

      Thus the joint posterior pdf of σ2 and α is given by
                                                           f (y|σ2 , α)π1 (σ2 )π2 (α)
                            π(σ2 , α|y) = RR                                             .                             (14)
                                                         f (y|σ2 , α)π1 (σ2 )π2 (α)dαdσ2

   Therefore, the Bayes estimator of any function of α and σ2 say g(α, σ2 ), under
squared error loss function is given by
                               RR
                                  g(σ2 , α)f (y|σ2 , α)π1 (σ2 )π2 (α)dαdσ2
        Eσ2 ,α [g(σ2 , α)|Y] =     RR                                      .  (15)
                                      f (y|σ2 , α)π1 (σ2 )π2 (α)dαdσ2

   It is not possible to compute the integral in (15). Thus we propose the MCMC
technique to generate sample from the posterior distribution and then compute
the Bayes estimator of σ2 and α. We use Gibbs sampling procedure to generate
sample from the posterior pdf.
      The joint posterior pdf of σ2 and α given in (14) based on RSS can be written
as
                       π RSS (σ2 , α|y) ∝ f RSS (y|σ2 , α)π1 (σ2 )π2 (α)

U nif orm(0, 1) prior for α and the pdf (1) for σ2 . Similarly, the joint posterior
densities of σ2 and α based on ERSS and MRSSU can be written as follows

    Since no full conditional densities are known analytically based on concomitant
RSS, ERSS and obviously based on bivariate MRSSU, we use the Metropolis-
Hastings (M-H) algorithm to draw samples from the joint posterior distributions.
By assuming truncated normal proposal distribution qα ∝ N (α(i−1) , τ 2 )I(0 < α <
1) for α and qσ2 ∝ N (σ2 (i−1) , τ 2 )I(σ2 > 0) for σ2 , the sampler works as follows:
                                                                                       (0)
     1. We begin with an initial guess value θ(0) = (σ2 , α(0) ) and set i = 1.

    The value of τ should be xed so that the optimized value of ρ is between
(0.3, 0.7). Now the approximation of Bayesian estimation of σ2 can be obtained
using the following equations

where, M is the burn-in period. Also, for α, we have
                                                    N
                                           1        X

Note 1. When the posteriors are not known analytically, then one can use the
method of Lindley (1980) as another technique for providing the Bayes estimator
for the parameter.


4. Simulation Study

   The simulation study are based on 1000 Monte Carlo runs, and 5000 samples
generated by using the M-H algorithm and discard the rst M = 1000 values
as burn-in period. The mean square error and bias of Bayesian estimation
of σ2 are obtained based on concomitant RSS, ERSS and MRSSU for values
σ2 = .5, α ∈ 0.25(0.25)0.75. We assume that the prior distribution of σ2 follows
S.R.IGamma(1,1). Also, the non informative prior is obtained by putting a = 0
and b = 0 in (1).
    The simulation study is repeated for n = 5(1)8 when α is known and then for
n = 2(1)5 when α is unknown and the results are presented in Table 1 and Table
2, respectively.
    From Table 1 it can be observed that in most cases the estimates of σ2 based
on concomitant ERSS and then MRSSU have the least MSE and bias. It is
also observed that the bias and MSE of all estimators based on RSS, ERSS and
MRSSU decrease with increasing n. From this Table a much variation between
estimators based on S.R.IGamma(1,1) prior and non-informative prior cannot be
seen. Also the estimators based on both priors follow the same eciency pattern
but estimators based on S.R.IGamma(1,1) give a slight improvement over non-
informative prior.
    Note that, when α is unknown, from Table 2 it is observed that the Bayes
estimators for σ2 based on concomitant MRSSU have MSE and bias smaller than
based on the other scheme sampling. Thus one can conclude that the estimators
of σ2 based on MRSSU perform better than estimators based on RSS and ERSS
when α is positive. But the bias and MSE of almost all of estimators of α based on
concomitant RSS are smaller than that of estimators based on ERSS and MRSSU.
In addition, as n increases, the MSE and bias values for both parameters σ2 and
α decrease.

Bayesian Estimation of Bivariate Rayleigh Distribution                                   293

5. Real Data Analysis

   In order to compare the performance of Bayesian estimates of the parameter
σ2 we consider a bivariate data set from the 44 women data included the body
weight(kg) (X ) and the resting metabolic rate (RMR) (kcal/24 hr) (Y ) reported
by Owen & et al. (1986). Since correlation between X and Y of the available
observations is 0.74, in addition to RSS we derived the Bayes estimator based
on ERSS and MRSSU. By taking samples of size 4 from two data sets based on
concomitant RSS, ERSS and MRSSU, Bayesian estimates of σ2 are obtained. The
obtained RSS, ERSS and MRSSU observations are given in Table 3.

    Table 3: The data based on RSS, ERSS and MRSSU from X and Y ; n = 4.
                           RSS            ERSS             MRSSU

                        55.0   1034    83.4      1248    104.5   1414
                        57.8   1090    143.3     1708    143.3   1708
                        86.2   1466    125.2     1630    123.1   1640
                        62.3   1402    62.3      1402     74.8   1273


    For the Bayesian estimations we used the prior pdf in (1) with a = b = 0.0001
to σ2 . The results are reported in Table 4. We can nd that the estimated values
for σ2 based on dierent samplings are close together.
    To obtain an estimator for the mean of study variable Y , we have obtained the
sample mean Ȳ of the 44 available Y observations and is given by Ȳ = 1339.84.
From Table 4, we can see that Bayes estimators based on MRSSU is closer to the
Ȳ than the other estimators. Note that when α is unknown while an estimator
of σ2 using MCMC method is obtained one can also get an estimator for α. This
obtained estimator for α is included in Table 4. Since the sample correlation
between all the available X and Y observations is 0.74, as given in Tahmasebi,
Jafari & Ahsanullah (2017) a rough estimate of α is obtained as 1. From Table
4 it can be seen that the estimator of α based on RSS is more close to estimator
based on sample correlation.

6. Conclusions

   In this paper, Bayesian estimation of the scale parameter σ2 for Morgenstern
type bivariate Rayleigh distribution based on RSS, ERSS and MRSSU are
considered. When the association parameter α is unknown Bayes estimators

are derived using MCMC method. By a simulation study dierence between the
estimation procedures are compared. Simulation results demonstrate that when α
is known, the Bayes estimates of σ2 based on ERSS are performed better than their
RSS and MRSSU counterparts. It is also observed that the bias and MSE of all
estimators decrease with increasing n. Also, when α is unknown the performance
of the Bayes estimators for σ2 based on MRSSU is better than based on the other
this study scheme sampling. But the bias and MSE of almost all of estimators of
α based on RSS are smaller than that of estimators based on ERSS and MRSSU.
In addition, as n increases, the MSE and bias values of all estimators for both
parameters σ2 and α decrease.
