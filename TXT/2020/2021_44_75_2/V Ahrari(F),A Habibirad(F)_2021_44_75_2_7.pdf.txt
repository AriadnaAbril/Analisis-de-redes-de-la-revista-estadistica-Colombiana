Abstract
In this article, rst new divergences are dened by using Tsallis divergence and a measure of discrepancy between equilibriums associated with two distributions is proposed.

To investigate the performance of the mentioned tests, Monte Carlo simulations are performed. In order to study the power, the alternatives are considered according to the failure rate function. The powers of the proposed tests are then compared with other existing tests. As regards the last step of the study, in order to explain the use of the proposed tests, three examples are presented.

1. Introduction

    Because of the importance of exponential distribution in reliability and lifetime
models, many tests with complete samples and some procedures under censored
data have been presented in previous studies, attempting to determine the
appropriateness of an exponential model for a given dataset. Type-I and Type-
II censoring schemes are the most popular ones among the dierent censoring
schemes. One of the disadvantages of these censoring schemes is the impossibility
to withdraw units during the experiment, so a generalization of the classical
Type-II censoring scheme, known as the progressive Type-II censoring scheme
(PCS Type-II), was proposed by analysts to pull back units amid the experiment.
PCS has gotten signicant consideration in the statistical writing (Balakrishnan
& Aggarwala, 2000; Balakrishnan, 2007).
    There are several goodness of t tests available in the literature based on
censored data for exponentiality test. Lim & Park (2007) provided a dierent
version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) information with the Type-II censored data for
the exponential and normal distributions. Balakrishnan et al. (2007) estimated the
joint entropy of a sample with PCS Type-II and proposed a test for exponentiality
based on corresponding KL information to the aformentioned joint entropy. Lin
et al. (2008) proposed a simple method for testing goodness of t based on Type-II
censored data. Yousefzadeh & Arghami (2008) estimated Shannon entropy by a
new estimator of distribution function and used it for testing exponentially and
normality. Wang (2008) introduced a test statistic for the exponential distribution
and obtained the exact distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
Habibirad et al. (2011) extended the goodness of t test based on KL information
for PCS Type-II data for three distributions. Salinas et al. (2012) proposed
goodness of t tests for the Gumbel distribution with Type-II right censored
data. Pakyari & Balakrishnan (2013) developed some goodness of t tests for the
exponential distribution based on Type-I censored samples. Recently; Park & Lim
(2015) generalized the cumulative residual KL (CRKL) information to the censored
case and used the estimate of modied version of CRKL as a goodness of t test
statistic with the Type-II censored data. Alizadeh Noughabi & Balakrishnan
(2015) developed a general goodness of t test for Type-II censored data by
using a new estimate of KL information for Type-II censored data. Also, they
considered testing for exponentiality under Type-II censored data as a special case
of this general test. Baratpour & Habibirad (2016) constructed two goodness of
t tests based on the CRKL and cumulative KL (CKL) information for testing
exponentiality with PCS Type-II data. Alizadeh Noughabi (2017) introduced a
general goodness of t test for PCS Type-II data based on a new estimate of KL
information and then used the proposed test statistic for testing exponentially
based on PCS Type-II data.
    The present paper aims to construct some tests using extentions of Tsallis
divergence based on the PCS Type-II sample for exponentiality test. The article is
divided to the following sections: Section 2 presents some preliminaries. In Section
3, the new divergences are introduced by using extentions of Tsallis divergence and
then test statistics are construcred. The powers of the proposed tests and existing

tests are then obtained through Monte Carlo simulations in Section 4. Finally,
using some examples, Section 5 illustrates the performance of all the tests.


2. Preliminaries

   In this section, some preliminary aspects are provided and in the next section
the proposed tests are introduced.
    The PCS can be described as follows. Under this general censoring scheme,
n units are placed on a life testing experiment and only m(< n) are completely
observed until failure. The censoring occurs progressively in m stages. At the time
of the rst failure (the rst stage) X1:m:n , R1 of the remaining n−1 surviving units
are randomly removed from the experiment. At the second failure (the second
stage) X2:m:n , R2 units are randomly removed from the remaining n − 2 − R1
units, and so on. The procedure is continued until all the remaining surviving
Rm = n − m − R1 − · · · − Rm−1 units are removed from the experiment at the time
of the mth failure (the mth stage) Xm:m:n . We will denote the m order observed
failure times by X1:m:n < X2:m:n < · · · < Xm:m:n and the PCS with the vector
R = (R1 , . . . , Rm ), which is xed previously. If R = (0, . . . , 0), then no censoring
is performed at any of the m stages and corresponds to the complete sample. If
R = (0, . . . , 0, n − m), we obtain the Type-II right censoring.
   Let X be a non negative absolutely continuous random variable having
cumulative distribution function (cdf) F , and the probability density function
(pdf) f . Then the Shannon (1948) information measure is dened as
                                   Z ∞
                         H(X) = −       f (x) ln f (x)dx.
                                          0

Rao et al. (2004) introduced a new uncertainty measure, the cumulative residual
entropy (CRE), which for a non negative random variable X is dened as follows:
                                    Z ∞
                        CRE(F ) = −      F̄ (x) ln F̄ (x)dx.
                                              0

Similar to the CRE, Di Crescenzo & Longobardi (2009) proposed the cumulative
entropy (CE) through
                                  Z ∞
                       CE(F ) = −     F (x) ln F (x)dx.
                                          0

Consider two nonnegative and absolutely continuous random variables X and Y
with pdfs f and g , cdfs F and G, respectively. Then, the KL informations as a
measure of discrepancy between f and g is given by
                                    Z ∞
                                                 f (x)
                        KL(f : g) =     f (x) ln       dx,
                                     0           g(x)
and the Tsallis divergence between f and g is dened as (Tsallis, 1988)
                            Z ∞                        -

Baratpour & Habibirad (2016) suggested an extension of the KL information to
the survival function, which is CRKL, as follows:
                               Z ∞
                                             F̄ (x)
             CRKL(F : G) =         F̄ (x) ln        dx − [E(X) − E(Y )],
                                0            Ḡ(x)

where F̄ (x) and Ḡ(x) are the survival functions of random variables X and Y ,
respectively.
   Park et al. (2012) considered another extension to the cumulative distribution,
which is called CKL and dened as follows:
                              Z ∞
                                           F (x)
              CKL(F : G) =        F (x) ln       dx − [E(Y ) − E(X)].
                               0           G(x)
Let w(t) be a non-negative function, so that 0 < E(w(t)) < ∞, then we can dene
the weighted random variable X ∗ with density function
                                         w(t)fX (t)
                             f ∗ (t) =              ,    t ≥ 0.                        (2)
                                         E(w(X))

The equilibrium distribution results as a special case when w(t) = rX1(t) , where
rX (t) = F̄fXX(t)
              (t)
                  is failure rate function of X ; then X ∗ is said the equilibrium random
                                                            X (t)
variable associated with X . The pdf of X ∗ is f ∗ (t) = F̄E(X)   (Gupta & Kirmani,
1990).
   Let f ∗ and g ∗ be the equilibrium pdfs respectively associated with f and g .
Then, we dene the Tsallis divergence based on equilibrium distributions as follows:
                              (Y ) ∞ α
                        α−1      Z                         -

                                                   (x)dx − 1 , α(6= 1) > 0. (3)
                α − 1 E α (X) 0
Suppose that x1:m:n < x2:m:n < · · · < xm:m:n are progressively Type-II right
censored data with the PCS R = (R1 , R2 , . . . , Rm ) from a continuous distribution
function F (x). Based on progressively Type-II right censored data, the cdf
estimator can be written as
             
              0,           x < x1:m:n
  Fm:n (x) =    αi:m:n ,    xi:m:n ≤ x < xi+1:m:n , i = 1, 2, . . . , m − 1       (4)
                             x ≥ xm:m:n
             
                αm:m:n ,

where αi:m:n = E(Ui:m:n ) is the expected value of the Type-II progressively
censored order statistic from the uniform distribution on (0,1), which is given
by Balakrishnan & Sandhu (1995) as
                            m                                

where F0 (x) = 1 − exp(− xθ ) with x > 0, θ > 0, and θ is the unknown parameter.
The performance of the proposed tests is, then, compared to exponentiality tests

3. Extentions of Tsallis Divergence and Test
      Statistics

   In this section new measures of distance between two distributions that are
similar to Tsallis divergences are dened.
Denition 1. Let X and Y be two non negative and absolutely continuous
random variables with cdfs F and G and pdfs f and g , respectively. Then
cumulative residual Tsallis (CRT) and cumulative Tsallis (CT) divergence between
these distributions are respectively as follows:
                          Z ∞                                           -
                      1
   CRT (F : G) =                  α
                                F̄ (x)Ḡ1−α
                                             (x)dx − αE(X) − (1 − α)E(Y ) , (5)
                   α−1 0

                         Z ∞
                      1
        CT (F : G) =           F α (x)G1−α (x)dx
                     α−1 0
                        Z ∞                   Z ∞       -                                         (6)
                     −α     F (x)dx − (1 − α)     G(x)dx ,                      0 < α < 1.
                              0                               0

Lemma 1. CRT(F:G)≥ 0 and equality holds i F = G.
Proof . By applying the Hölder inequality, we obtain
Z ∞                           Z ∞            α Z ∞        1−α
      F̄ α (x)Ḡ1−α (x)dx ≤           F̄ (x)dx        Ḡ(x)dx     ,                  0 < α < 1, (7)
 0                                0                       0

and by using the Young inequality, we get
Z ∞           α Z ∞        1−α    Z ∞                    Z ∞
       F̄ (x)dx        Ḡ(x)dx     ≤α     F̄ (x)dx + (1 − α)     Ḡ(x)dx. (8)
   0                 0                         0                         0


Therefore, by (7) and (8) and dividing by α − 1, the desired inequality follows.
In the Hölder inequality, equality holds iRF̄ = cḠ (c is Ra positive constant) and
                                             ∞               ∞
in the Young inequality, equality holds i 0 F̄ (x)dx = 0 Ḡ(x)dx. Thus, c = 1
and CRT (F : G) = 0 i F = G.


Lemma 2. CT(F:G)≥ 0 and equality holds i F = G.

Proof . The proof is similar to the Lemma 1.
Remark 1. Note that limα→1 CRT = CRKL and limα→1 CT = CKL.
   In order to construct test statistics, the given properties in Lemma 1 and 2 can
be taken as proper motivators.


3.1. Testing Procedures Based on the Extentions of Tsallis
       Divergence


   In this section, by utilizing (4) and estimating new divergences, test statistics
are constructed for testing exponentiality with the PCS Type-II data and then
some competing tests are considered to be compared with the mentioned tests.
Accordingly, letting F (x) = Fm:n (x) and G(x) = F0 (x) in (5), we have

4. Simulation Study

    For large values of the proposed test statistics, the null hypothesis will be
rejected. The power values of the proposed tests depend on two things, the α
values and type of failure rate function of alternatives. Thus, the alternatives are
selected according to the type of failure rate function as follows:

    Increasing failure rate (IFR): Gamma and Weibull (shape parameter 2),

    Decreasing failure rate (DFR): Gamma and Weibull (shape parameter 0.5),

    Non-monotone failure rate (NFR): Log-normal (shape parameter 0.5), Log-
     normal (shape parameter 1).

Since the α values have an important role in determining the power of the proposed
tests, then the α value that maximizes the power, is considered according to the
type of failure rate function. Moreover since the CTmn and CRTmn statistics have
not good performance, respectively, for alternatives with IFR and DFR functions,
thus the CTmn and CRTmn statistics are recommended for DFR function and IFR
function, respectively.
    The α value, for DTmn∗  and CRTmn statistics, when the alternatives have the
IFR function, is suggested to be 2 and 0.01, respectively and for DT∗ mn and CTmn
statistics, when the alternatives have the DFR function, is suggested to be 0.01.
For alternatives with NFR functions, the α value is suggested 0.01 for the proposed
statistics. The power values are determined for the 27 censoring schemes used
by Pakyari & Balakrishnan (2012). These censoring schemes are given in Table
1. To obtain the power values 50,000 random samples for several sample sizes

and PCS, are generated. Results showed that, when the alternative model is the
exponential model, signicance level of the test is concluded. Also by following
Alizadeh Noughabi (2017), the values of w which maximize the power of the T A
statistic are chosen.

    Tables 2-4 present power values of the proposed tests and the existing tests at
the signicance level 0.10 based on the type of failure rate function. According to
these tables, it can be said that the proposed tests are evidency consistent because
with increasing sample size, the test power close to 1. Table 2 (for alternatives
with IFR functions) indicates that, almost in the most cases, the T A statistic has
higher power than other tests. Also, we can see that, the dierence of powers
of the CRTmn and T A statistics do not dier much. Although the T A statistics
have good powers. One of the disadvantages of this statistic is that we should
calculate the power values for three dierent values of window size w, and, for
dierent censoring schemes, there is not a window size w of same value. While if
Balakrishnan et al. (2007) had considered w values proposed by Alizadeh Noughabi
(2017) for each censorship plan, they would have had higher powers compared to
TA.

For each censoring scheme, the greatest powers are in bold.



   Since usually the CRTmn statistic for the scheme R = (n − m, 0, . . . , 0)
shows higher power than the other schemes, so this statistic for early censoring is
recommended. In Table 3 for alternatives with DER functions, the CTmn statistic
has higher power than DT∗ mn and the other existing tests except in the censoring
scheme 24. In this table, the scheme R = (n−m, 0, . . . , 0) generally indicates better
power than the other schemes. It can be concluded that early censoring situations
seem to possess higher power. Therefore for alternatives with DER functions, the
use of CTmn statistic for the case of early censoring is recommended. Table 4
shows that the T A and CRTmn statistics have approximately higher powers than
the other tests, but for dierent censoring schemes a general conclusion cannot be
suggested.

5. Illustrative Examples

    In this section, the proposed tests procedure are investigated by three examples.
In the rst example, the real dataset with n = 19 and m = 8 is considered, and in
the second example, a real dataset with n = 32 and m = 20 is applied. Finally a
real dataset with n = 20 and m = 10 is used in Example 3. In the examples, the
DT∗ mn statistic has the same results for the α values equal to 2 and 0.01.

Example 1. Nelson (1982) reported data on times to breakdown of an in-sulating
uid in an accelerated test which was done at dierent test voltages. From these
data, Viveros & Balakrishnan (1994) produced a PCS Type-II sample of size from
observations which was recorded at 34 kilovolts.

    These progressively censored data are given in Table 5. Table 6 indicates
the critical values and test statistics. Based on Table 6, all of the tests at the
signicance level 0.10, show that this progressively Type-II right censored sample
comes from an exponential distribution.


Example 2. The data of the study by Spineili & Stephens (1987) is considered
in this example which consists of the modules of repute of woods. By randomly
generating observations from these data, Balakrishnan & Lin (2003) considered
PCS Type-II data. The data and the employed PCS are presented in Table 7.
Pakyari & Balakrishnan (2012) concluded that for the given PCS Type-II data,
the Weibull model is accepted at the signicance level 0.05. The critical values
and test statistics for the proposed tests and the other tests of this paper, were
calculated in Table 8. The results of Table 10 show that, all of the test statistics
reject the null hypothesis of exponentiality at the signicance level 0.10. It should

Example 3. Pakyari & Balakrishnan (2012) randomly generated a PCS Type-II
sample of size m = 10 from n = 20 observations based on the wire connection
strength data from Nelson (1982, Table 5.1, p. 111). The data, and the PCS
employed are given in Table 9. Nelson (1982) and Pakyari & Balakrishnan
(2012) concluded that normal model is strongly supported for describing the wire
connection strength data. The test statistics and the critical values are presented in
Table 10. Based on Table 10, as expected the exponential model at the signicance
level 0.10, is supported by none of the test statistics. It should be note that the
obtained values for test statistics in Alizadeh Noughabi (2017) in Example 1 and
the conclusions drawn from it are not correct. These values were modied in

6. Conclusion

    We dened new divergence measures as generalizations of the Tsallis divergence
and considered testing exponentiality based on the PCS Type-II sample. In order
to compare the power values of proposed tests with the power values of existing
tests, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results showed that,
for alternative hypothesis with IFR and DER functions, the dierence of powers
of CRTmn and T A tests are not remarkable. Due to the problems stated for
the T A test, the CRTmn test for the censorship scheme R = (n − m, 0, . . . , 0) it is
suggested. Moreover, the CTmn test for alternative hypothesis with DER function,
for almost all censorship schemes, has higher power than the other existing tests.
