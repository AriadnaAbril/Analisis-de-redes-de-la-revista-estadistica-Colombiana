Abstract
This paper proposes a spatial multivariate CUSUM control chart in order to monitor the mean of a single characteristic of a product or process, when the measurements are taken in diﬀerent locations on each sampled item. To estimate the variance and covariance matrix some tools from the geostatistics are used, taking into account the spatial correlation between the measurements. The performance of this control chart is explored by simulation and its use is illustrated with an example.
Key words: Mutivariate control charts; Multivariate CUSUM; Spatial correlation; Semivariogram.

among which are included the control charts. The processes always have varia-
tion, which can be inherent or natural to the characteristics of the process, called
common cause variation; or obey special circumstances that are not permanent
in the process, called assignable (or special) cause variation. When a process is
operating in the presence of special causes, it is considered to be unstable or out
of statistical control (OC); otherwise, the process is considered to be stable or in
statistical control (IC). A fundamental objective of a control chart is to analyze
the variability of the process and quickly detect assignable causes when they occur.
Readers interested in this topic can consult the following textbooks: Ryan (2011),
Qiu (2013) and Montgomery (2019), among others.
    Generally, the statistical process control can be divided in two phases called
phase I or retrospective phase and phase II or prospective phase. In phase I a
set historical process data is used to learn about the process. Among the main
goals of phase I are: to understand the sources of process variability, to evaluate
the process stability searching unusual results and removing assignable causes of
variation, and to estimate the in-control process parameters. The major goal of
the phase II is to detect any change from the assumed in-control model. Technical
details, comments on some of the important aspects of phase I analysis and review
about this area can be found in Chakraborti, Human & Graham (2008) and Jones-
Farmer, Woodall, Steiner & Champ (2014).
    In industry there are many processes characterized for two or more quality
characteristics, generally correlated. Several multivariate control charts have been
proposed for monitoring these processes, among which are the proposals elabo-
rated by Hotteling (1947), Alt & Smith (1988), Crosier (1988), Pignatiello Jr &
Runger (1990), Lowry, Woodall, Champ & Rigdon (1992), Khoo, Wu, Castagliola
& Lee (2013), (Lee, Khoo & Xie 2014) and Nezhad & Niaki (2013). The traditional
multivariate control charts ignore the correlation between adjacent sample loca-
tions, a situation common in some modern manufacturing processes. For example,
the problem of monitoring at diﬀerent locations bottle-wall thickness used for soft
drinks and other beverages (Grimshaw, Blades & Miles 2013), or the identification
of local distortions surrounding the cylinder bores in a deck face on an automotive
engine head, which impact the sealing performance of engine assemblies and reflect
cutting force dynamics during machining processes, Suriano, Wang, Shao, Hu &
Sekhar (2015). Some proposals that consider the correlation of adjacentes sites
have been recently developed by Wang, Jiang & Li (2016) and Zhang, Liu & Jung
(2019). Some recent review papers about multivariate control charts are Woodall
& Montgomery (2014), Capizzi (2015), Bersimis, Sgora & Psarakis (2018), and
Peres & Fogliatto (2018).
    Most multivariate control charts seek to monitor multiple quality characteris-
tics simultaneously, however Grimshaw et al. (2013) propose a spatial T 2 control
chart and a multivariate EWMA chart (MEWMA) in order to monitor the mean
of spatial data (a single quality characteristic at diﬀerent spatial locations), that is,
instead of measuring multiple quality characteristics, only one quality character-
istic is measured in multiple sites of the product or process. These control charts
are based on multivariate control charts where the sample covariance matrix is
replaced with a parametrized covariance matrix based on the semivariogram that

models the spatial correlation, under the assumption that the process is isotropic
stationary Gaussian. While the proposals presented by Grimshaw et al. (2013)
monitor the mean of a spatial process, Garthoﬀ & Otto (2015) recently considered
the problem of simultaneously monitoring the mean and covariance of multivariate
spatial processes using conventional MEWMA and multivariate cumulative sums
(MCUSUM) control charts. It is important to highlight that the proposals pre-
sented by Grimshaw et al. (2013) deal with the detection of changes in the mean
of the spatial process over time, while the proposal presented by Garthoﬀ & Otto
(2015) searches to detect changes in the mean and covariance of the spatial process
in terms of the distance from a known centre of the spatial process; therefore, the
run length is not anymore a point of time but a distance in space.
    In many manufacturing processes the quality of a process or product is best
described by a function, called a profile, this is, a functional relationship between
a variable and a set of explanatory variables. In these cases, the point of interest
are the changes in the profile over time. Profile monitoring is an example of multi-
variate monitoring and it also includes the monitoring of two-dimensional shapes
and three-dimensional surfaces, Woodall & Montgomery (2014). Some control
charts proposed for monitoring processes characterized for profiles are based on
multivariate control charts, among which are the approaches proposed by Kang &
Albin (2000) and Williams, Woodall & Birch (2007). Among the control charts
proposed for monitoring surface that consider the spatial correlation are the pro-
posals made by Wang, Wang & Tsung (2014) and Colosimo, Cicorella, Pacella
& Blaco (2014). Wang et al. (2014) proposed a control chart in phase II, that
describes the spatial correlations among variables in 2-D surface data. This chart
is based on the Gaussian-Kriging model, in which the spatial correlations within
the 2-D surface profile are represented by a parametric function. The proposal
presented by Colosimo et al. (2014) models the manufactured surface via Gaus-
sian processes models and monitoring the deviations of the actual surface from
the target pattern estimated in phase I. In this sense, the control charts pro-
posed by Grimshaw et al. (2013) may be extendend for monitoring profiles with
spatial dependence. Readers interested in reading about profile monitoring can
consult Woodall, Spitzner, Montgomery & Gupta (2004), Woodall (2007), and
Noorossana, Saghaei & Amiri (2011), among others.
    The control charts proposed by Grimshaw et al. (2013), based on the T 2 and
multivariate EWMA control charts, allow to monitor the mean of a spatial process.
The first is designed to detect great shifts in the mean of the spatial process while
the last is designed to detect smaller shifts. Although Grimshaw et al. (2013) pro-
posed these two new control charts taking account the spatial dependence, only the
performance of the control chart based on the T 2 statistic is evaluated in the simu-
lations and illustrated in the example. Other well-known and eﬀective alternative
to the multivariate EWMA control chart for detecting small sustained shifts in the
mean vector is the multivariate cumulative sum control chart, Montgomery (2019).
According to our knowledge, there is no MCUSUM control chart in the literature
to monitor the mean of a spatial process. In this paper, we propose an extension
of a multivariate CUSUM chart that takes into account the spatial dependence
between the measurements of a single quality characteristic in diﬀerent product

locations, where the covariance matrix is determined by the semivariogram that
models the spatial correlation.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents some basic concepts of
spatial statistics. Section 3 describes the control charts proposed by Grimshaw
et al. (2013) for monitoring the mean of a spatial process. In Section 4, the spatial
multivariate CUSUM control chart is proposed. Section 5 presents a simulation
study to evaluate the performance of the spatial T 2 , EWMA charts and the new
spatial MCUSUM control chart, to detect changes in the mean of a spatial process
in phase II. An example that illustrates the use of the control chart proposed is
given in Section 6. Finally, a summary of results, conclusions and some recom-
mendations are presented in Section 7.


2. Spatial Data Analysis
    Spatial data analysis is the set of statistical techniques for the proper analy-
sis of spatial data, which makes use of the spatial referencing and Geographical
Information Systems (GIS) techniques and methods. In this context, the spatial
dependence is considered a fundamental property (Haining 2003), where spatially
near observations tend to be more similar than distant observations, property
known as Tobler’s law of geography (Tobler 1970). In this sense, the strength
of the relationships between spatially distributed quantities is a function of their
spatial separation, (Schabenberger & Pierce 2001).
    Let s ∈ D be a generic location data in d-dimensional Euclidean space and
suppose the potential datum Z(s) at spatial location s is a random quantity,
where s varies over index set D ⊂ Rd generating the multivariate random field
{Z(s) : s ∈ D}, with Z(s) = [Z(s)1 , . . . , Z(sp )]′ . The characteristics of the index
set D determine the type of spatial data: Geostatistical data, if D is continuous
and fixed; lattice data, if D is discrete and fixed; and point patterns, if the set of
locations is itself random, (Cressie 2015).
    Stationarity means that the random fields looks similar in diﬀerent parts of the
domain D, (Schabenberger & Pierce 2001). There are three types of stationarity:
strict, second-order and intrinsic. The process is strict (or strong) stationarity if
the spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordinates by the
vector h, that is, P (Z(s1 ) < z1 , . . . , Z(sp ) < zp ) = P (Z(s1 + h) < z1 , . . . , Z(sp +
h) < zp ). The process {Z(s) : s ∈ D ⊂ Rd } is called second-order stationary if:

     a. The expected value (mean of the random field) exists and does not depend
        on locations E[Z(s)] = µ, for all s ∈ D

     b. The covariance function is finite and only depends on the distance between
        the locations, that is, Cov(Z(s), Z(s + h)) = C(h). The function C(·) is
        called covariogram or covariance function.

     c. The variance function is defined by the literal b when h = 0, therefore
        V ar(Z(s)) = C(0) = σ 2 < ∞ does not depend on the location.

                                           Revista Colombiana de Estadística 43 (2020) 49–70

Spatial MCUSUM Control Chart                                                           53

   The process {Z(s) : s ∈ D ⊂ Rd } is called intrinsically stationary if E[Z(s)] =
µ and V ar(Z(s) − Z(s + h)) = 2γ(h). The function γ(h) is called the semivari-
ogram of the spatial process.
   If a random field is strictly stationary it is also second-order stationary, but
the reverse is not necessarily true. A Gaussian random field is defined as a ran-
dom function whose finite-dimensional distributions are multivariate Gaussian. If
a Gaussian random field is second-order stationary it is also strictly stationary,
(Schabenberger & Pierce 2001).
    A second-order stationary process is also intrinsically stationary, but intrinsic
stationarity does not imply second-order stationarity, (Schabenberger & Gotway
2017). Second-order stationarity implies the following relationship between the
semivariogram function and the covariogram function:


                                γ(h) = C(0) − C(h).                                   (1)

    Whereas in a stationary random field the absolute coordinate diﬀerences are
immaterial, the orientation (angle) of the lag vector h matters. If the semivari-
ogram or covariance function do not depend on the direction of the lag vector h,
but these depends only on the absolute distance between points, the random field
is termed isotropic, (Schabenberger & Gotway 2017).
   In a second-order isotropy stationary random field with isotropic covariogram
the covariance between any two points Z(s) and Z(s + h) is only a function of
the Euclidean distance between the two points, Cov(Z(s), Z(s + h)) = C(∥h∥),
Schabenberger & Pierce (2001).
    For a second-order stationary random field, the isotropic semivariogram has a
typical form showed in the Figure 1, where one can observe the following elements:
nugget eﬀect, sill and range. The nugget eﬀect, denoted by τ 2 , represents the
discontinuity at the origin of the semivariogram, which may be due to the fact
that part of the spatial structure is concentrated at distances less than observed.
The sill, denoted by σ 2 , corresponds to the upper asymptote of the semivariogram
and it represents the V ar[Z(s)] = C(0). The range, denoted by ϕ, refers to the
distance from which two observations are spatially uncorrelated.
    The semivariogram is a function of the spatial process and as such satisfies
certain properties, among these, the semivariogram must be conditionally negative-
definite, this is

    The goal of semivariogram estimation is to estimate the unknown parameters
of a theoretical semivariogram model γ(h, θ). Estimation of the semivariogram is
not easy because it must be conditionally negative definite. Estimating a semi-
variogram is usually a two-step process: (i) to derive an empirical estimate of the
semivariogram from the data and (ii) to fit a theoretical semivariogram model to
the empirical estimate, Schabenberger & Pierce (2001).
    The semivariogram conveys information of the spatial dependence of a random
field. An unbiased estimator of the semivariogram, called the classical semivari-
ogram estimator or Matheron estimator, is given by

                                  1            ∑
                     γ̂(h) =                            (Z(si ) − Z(sj ))2                (3)
                               2|N (h)|
                                          (si ,sj )∈N (h)

where N (h) is the set of locations pairs that are separated by the lag vector h and
|N (h)| denotes the cardinality of this set.
    Estimation of the semivariogram by parametric statistical methods requires the
selection of a semivariogram model γ(h, θ), where θ is a vector of parameters that
is estimated from the data by direct or indirect methods (methods that process the
data in some form generating summary amounts, and then fit the semivariogram
model to these summaries). Functions that serve as semivariogram models must
be conditionally negative definite, Schabenberger & Pierce (2001). Among the
semivariogram models more common we found the linear, spherical, exponential,
Matern and Gaussian model. In particular, the exponential model is given by
                               {
                                   0                            ∥ h ∥= 0,
                   γ(h, θ) =                (             )                               (4)
                                   τ 2 + σ 2 1 − e−3∥h∥/ϕ       ∥ h ∦= 0.

   For the exponential semivariogram to be valid we need to have τ 2 ≥ 0, σ 2 ≥ 0,
and ϕ ≥ 0. The covariance function of the exponential model without nugget eﬀect
is                              {
                                  σ2 ,             ∥ h ∥= 0,
                     C(h, θ) =                                                 (5)
                                  σ 2 (e−3∥h∥/ϕ ), ∥ h ∥> 0.

   The more flexible Matern semivariogram model is given by

3. Control Charts for the Mean of a Spatial
   Process
    Grimshaw et al. (2013) proposed two control charts for monitoring the mean of
a spatial process, based on the classical multivariate T 2 control chart and MEWMA
control chart. In these control charts instead of measuring multiple quality charac-
teristics, only one quality characteristic is measured in multiple sites of the product
or process, where the spatial dependendency sctructure of the process is repre-
sented by the parametrized covariance matrix based on the semivariogram that
models the spatial correlation, under the assumption that the process is isotropic
stationary Gaussian.
     Let Zj,t = [Zj,t (s1 ), . . . , Zj,t (sp )]′ be a p × 1 vector with the measurements of
the quality characteristic on the jth product, j = 1, . . . , n, at the time t, from the
spatial process {Z(s) : s ∈ D}. When the process is in control, µ(s) = µ0 , for all
s, but when the process is out of control, µ(s) ̸= µ0 for at least one location s. Let
Z̄ t be mean vector of the n sampled products at each of the p locations, at the
time t. Under the assumption that Zj,t is an isotropic stationary Gaussian process
with mean E(Z(s)) = µ(s) = µ0 , the T 2 control chart produces an out-control
signal when
                          Tt2 = n(Z̄ t − µ0 )′ Σ(θ0 )−1 (Z̄ t − µ0 )                     (7)

   exceeds the upper control limit χ2 (1/ARL0 ; p), where ARL0 denotes the in-
control ARL, µ0 = [µ0 , . . . , µ0 ]′ is the in-control mean vector and Σ(θ0 ) is the
covariance matrix based on the semivariogram that models the spatial correlation
with parameters θ0 .
    The spatial multivariate EWMA control chart proposed by Grimshaw et al.
(2013) detects small and medium shifts, sustained over time, in the mean of a
spatial process, based on the classical MEWMA control chart. This new chart
signals a process is out of control at time t when

exceeds the upper control limit, where

with 0 < λ ≤ 1 and
                                       (                              )

4. Spatial multivariate CUSUM Control Chart
    Grimshaw et al. (2013) proposed two control charts for monitoring the mean
of a spatial process based on the classical T 2 and MEWMA control charts. The
spatial control chart is a straighforward application of the T 2 control chart, there-
fore this control chart is relatively insensitive to small and moderate shifts in the
mean vector because it uses information only from the current sample. The spa-
tial control chart can be used in both phase I and phase II situations. The spatial
MEWMA control chart is a modified version of the classical MEWMA chart, was
designed to detect small and medium shifts that persist over time, and as in the
MEWMA chart, this version is a phase II procedure.
    Other well-known and eﬀective alternative to the multivariate EWMA chart
for detecting small sustained shifts in the mean is the multivariate cumulative sum
chart, Montgomery (2019). In this paper, we propose an extension of a multivari-
ate CUSUM chart that takes into account the spatial dependence between the
measurements of a single quality characteristic in diﬀerent product locations for
monitoring the mean of a spatial process. In this new chart, under the assumption
that the process is isotropic stationary Gaussian, the spatial dependendency sc-
tructure of the process is represented by the parametrized covariance matrix based
on the semivariogram that models the spatial correlation. We will call this new
chart as spatial MCUSUM, which is based on the classical MCUSUM proposed by
Crosier (1988).
    Let Z j,t (s) = [Zj,t (s1 ), . . . , Zj,t (sp )]′ , j = 1, . . . , n, be an vector in phase II,
at a time t, with the measurements on the jth product of the quality charac-
teristic of interest taken at the locations s1 , . . . , sp . We assume that Z j,t is an
isotropic stationary Gaussian process with mean vector µ0 = [µ0 (s1 ), . . . , µ0 (sp )]′ ,
E(Zj (si )) = µ0 (si ) = µ0 , and covariance matrix determined by the semivariogram
that models the spatial correlation, Σ(θ 0 ). The in-control mean vector µ0 de-

   The chart gives a signal of spatial process mean shift at the t-th time point
when Ut > h, where h > 0 is the control limit chosen to reach a pre-specified
ARL0 value, Σ(θ 0 ) is constructed from the semivariogram, and θ 0 contains the
parameters of the semivariogram of a second-order stationary random field, for
example, θ 0 = (σ 2 , ϕ) for an exponential semivariogram model without nugget
eﬀect. When Ct is less than or equal to k, St is set to be 0, because there is little
evidence of process mean shift in such cases, Qiu (2013).
    The spatial MCUSUM control chart is based on the assumption that the pro-
cess is isotropic stationary Gaussian, therefore the assumptions of normality, con-
stant variance at all s, and isotropy must be guaranteed. Qiu (2008) and Qiu
(2013) showed that the actual IC ARL values of the traditional MCUSUM chart
are far away from their nominal IC ARL value for some non-normal distributions.
If the number of locations is larger than the number of observations, (p ≫ n),
the central limit theorem is not applicable, therefore the distribution of the sam-
ple mean vector may be multivariate non-normal when the observations from a
multivariate non-normal process. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the
process is Gaussian. Initially, we would test the multivariate normality for the
finite-dimensional distribution at the specific locations where the quality charac-
teristic is measured, using some tests such as Mardia’s, Henze-Zirkler’s, or Roys-
ton’s test or some graphical approaches such as chi-square Q-Q plot; but this
does not guarantee that the spatial process is Gaussian. Some tests have been
designed to determine whether a spatial process is Gaussian. Yuan (2000) derived
tests of Gaussianity for stationary random fields on Z d (d ≥ 1) based on the es-
timated kth-order spectrum (k > 2) at all the discrete frequencies. He used the
likelihood-ratio principle. Di Bernardino, Estrade, León et al. (2017) dealt with
a real-valued stationary isotropic random field and used the information given by
level functionals of a single realization of the process to build a test of Gaussianity.
The level functional is the Euler characteristic (EC) of the excursion sets above
some levels. More research is required to study the robustness of the proposed
spatial MCUSUM chart, as well as the development of new robust control charts
to monitor the mean of a single characteristic of a product or process, when the
measurements are taken in diﬀerent locations on each sampled item.
   An user may use graphical diagnostics, such as directional sample variograms,
rose diagrams, and empirical semivariogram contour plot to decide whether the

assumption of isotropy is reasonable. These graphical techniques can be diﬃcult
to assess, open to subjective interpretations, and misleading. Hypothesis tests of
the assumption of isotropy may be more objective. To this end, we found among
others, the proposals formulated by Cabaña (1987), Maity & Sherman (2012), and
Weller & Hoeting (2020).
   There are only few papers that discuss hypothesis tests of stationarity, among
these, Fuentes (2005) presented a test of stationarity for spatial random fields
based on spatial spectral analysis (spectral functions which are space dependent),
under the assumption that the spatial random field is on a regular grid. The
proposed method consists essentially in testing the homogeneity of a set of spatial
spectra evaluated at diﬀerent locations.
    Because the assumption of isotropic stationary spatial process, when the pro-
cess is in control, the mean of the quality characteristic that describes the spatial
process is constant for all location. If the spatial MCUSUM chart exhibits an
out-of-control signal, at least one of the physical locations departs from the spec-
ifications. Because the spatial correlation, using kriging the users can predict the
quality charateristic at locations where measurements were not taken. Therefore,
the sample unit can be diagnosed with a graphic representing measurements at all
locations, and thus detect defective regions.
   Because the assumption of stationarity of the spatial process and to the fact
that the in-control covariance matrix is a function of the parameters of the semi-
variogram and the distances for each pair of points, the spatial MCUSUM control
chart can be computed even if the spatial measurement locations and/or the num-
ber of spatial measurements p change.
    The eﬃcient estimation of semivariogram parameters is aﬀected by the se-
lected sampling design, this is, the number of sites and the spatial configuration
where measurements are taken. Grimshaw et al. (2013) pointed out, the optimal
allocation scheme depends on the type of defects that are of concern: the best
performance is obtained when the measurement grid is chosen to cover the loca-
tions and types of anticipated defects and then the sample size maximized subject
to resource constraints. In this paper, we do not study the eﬀect that the imple-
mentation of some sample design criteria would have on the performance of the
proposed control chart. It would be interesting to investigate this issue. Some
design criteria, among others, have been proposed by Bogaert & Russo (1999),
Müller & Zimmerman (1999), Marchant & Lark (2007). An interesting review
about this issue is presented by Zimmerman & Buckland (2019).
    In the spatial MCUSUM chart the covariance matrix is determined by the
semivariogram that models the spatial correlation. The semivariogram is a pa-
rameter of the spatial process that generally must be estimated from the data in
phase I, usually in a procedure of two steps: (1) derive an empirical estimate of the
semivariogram from the data and (2) fit a theoretical semivariogram model to the
empirical estimate. There are various methods of fitting semivariogram models,
such as least squares, maximum likelihood, and robust methods (Cressie 2015).
These techniques require a large number of variogram points. Another alternative
is a visual fit of the variogram points to a few standard models. A visual check

against a fitted theoretical model is appropriate (Hohn 1998). Studying both the
impact of the misspecifying the semivariogram model and the eﬀect of estimating
the parameters of the semivariogram on the performance of the spatial MCUSUM
chart in phase II are issues of great importance that are not addressed in this
paper, which deserve further investigation.


5. Simulations
    In this section, we present some simulation results to evaluate, in phase II, the
numerical performance of the proposed spatial MCUSUM chart. We have orga-
nized these results in three subsections: in the first, the spatial T 2 , MCUSUM and
MEWMA control charts are compared and the eﬀects of sample sizes and mag-
nitude of the non-centrality parameter are analyzed; in the second, the eﬀects of
the range of the semivariogram model in the performance of the spatial MCUSUM
chart are evaluated, and finally the third subsection evaluates the robustness of
the performance of the spatial MCUSUM control chart under deviations in the
normality assumption.
    The simulations are carried out under the hypothesis that the spatial corre-
lations come from a exponential model without a nugget eﬀect with parameters
σ 2 = 0.03 and ϕ = 1. A spatial measurement grid density of 12 points is consid-
ered, with 1.5 units between points.


5.1. Performance Comparison Between the Spatial T 2 ,
     MEWMA and MCUSUM Control Charts
   We compare the numerical performance of the proposed spatial MCUSUM
chart with the performance of the spatial T 2 and spatial MEWMA (considering
λ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8) control charts. In order to measure the numerical perfor-
mance of the proposed control chart in phase II, we calculate the average run
length for diﬀerent changes in the mean vector, (ARL1 ). The level of shifts in the
mean vector is described by the non-centrality parameter (ncp), which is defined
as                                    ′
                       δ = ((µ1 − µ0 ) [Σ(θ 0 )]−1 (µ1 − µ0 ))1/2              (14)
where µ0 represents a vector of means under control and µ1 the new vector of
means, (Montgomery 2019). Large values of δ represent large shifts in the mean
vector. When δ = 0, the mean process is under control and the measure of
performance is denoted as ARL0 .
   Two sample sizes are explored: n1 = 1 and n6 = 6. For the three spatial
control charts considerated, the control limits and ARL are calculated using the
next algorithm:

  1. An initial control limit (h) is established.

     2. Under the assumption that the spatial process is isotropic, stationary and
        Gaussian, random vectors from a multivariate normal distribution are sim-
        ulated with mean vector zero (µ0 = 0) and covariance matrix defined by an
        exponential semivariogram model (Σ0 ) until the control statistic exceeds the
        value of the control limit h.
     3. The run length (RL) is calculated.
     4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated 100.000 times and the ARL is estimated.

the spatial correlation from an exponential model without nugget eﬀect with
σ 2 = 0.03 and ϕ = 1. The performace of these control charts is calculated for
9 values of δ. For small shifts in the mean vector (δ=0.06 to δ=0.312) the spatial
MCUSUM chart has better performance than the spatial T 2 and MEWMA control
charts. For moderate shifts in the mean vector (δ = 0.696, 1 and 2.02) the spatial
MEWMA(λ = 0.1) presents better performance. For large shifts (δ = 3), the
spatial T 2 and MEWMA control charts show a better performance when n = 6,
while the MEWMA(λ = 0.1) is better for n = 1.

   Table 2 presents a comparison in the performance of the spatial MCUSUM
chart for n = 6 and diﬀerent values of range (ϕ) in the exponential model consid-

values of the range, that is, the spatial MCUSUM chart is not sensitive to changes
presented by the parameter ϕ.

are generalizations of the classical univariate Student t distribution. Multivariate
t-distributions oﬀer a more viable alternative with respect to real-world data, par-
ticularly because its tails are more realistic than the multivariate normal distribu-
tion. This distribution has been used in diﬀerent fields such as physics, engineering
and finance. Its degrees of freedom parameter, υ, is also referred to as the shape
parameter, because the peakedness of the density function may be diminished,
preserved, or increased by varying υ (Nadarajah & Kotz 2005). The covariance
matrix of this distribution is only defined if υ > 2 (Frey 2010). Other family of
distributions with applications in the real world is the Multivariate generalized
hyperbolic distributions (MGH distributions). The MGH distributions were intro-
duced by Barndorﬀ-Nielsen (1978). These distributions in general are skewed and
represent an attractive family of distributions with exponentially decreasing tails
for multivariate data modelling (Frey 2010). Under the exponential model con-
sidered and n = 6, Table 4 shows the performance of the spatial MCUSUM chart
under three diﬀerent distributions: multivariate normal, multivariate t-student
with υ = 3 and 10, and M GH(0.5, 0.5, 2, µ0 , Σ(θ0 ), 0).

   According to the obtained results, the performance of the spatial MCUSUM
control chart is sensitive to the distributional assumption. However, because the
control limits are found by simulation to guarantee a predetermined ARL in-
control, no distributional assumptions are required for the data.


6. Example
    To illustrate the application of the proposed spatial MCUSUM control chart,
we consider the problem of monitoring bottle thickness presented by (Grimshaw
et al. 2013). The production of bottles is done by a blown model, which can vary
the thickness of the bottle-wall when the air pressure is not uniform in the time,
causing the surface of the bottle to curve inward. Bottle-wall thickness is measured

Spatial MCUSUM Control Chart                                                          63

using a nondestructive ultrasound micrometer. Bottle is a three-dimensional ob-
ject, which is represented more simply in two dimensions “unwrapping” the bottle.

    In this example, according to the requirements of the manufacturer, 8 locations
of the bottles were selected (p), which belongs the phase I sample, with a uniform
thickness of 0.055 inch. The sample is made up 26 bottles, includes four locations
around the cylinder at two heights, p = 8. There were m = 4 days where n = 6
bottles were measured in a thick spatial measurement grid, to improve production
of semivariogram for distances close to zero were collected in two other denser
spatial measurement grids, a 5 × 5 grid with dimensions of 0.25 inches away one
day and a 5 × 5 grid with dimensions of 0.125 inches away the other day. These
measurements are skewed, but the log transformation produces data that are ap-
proximately distributed as multivariate normal, according to multivariate version
of the statistic Shapiro-Wilk (p-value= 0.6832).

      The in-control mean vector is µ0 = ln(0.055)1p = −2.91p , where 1p is an p × 1
column vector of ones. The in-control covariance matrix is estimated based on
the semivariogram that models the spatial correlation. Figure 2 shows the plot
     (Z(si )−Z(sj ))2
of           2        against the arc distance measured in inches, d(si , sj ), for each
pair of points on the bottles from the phase I sample (first 4 days), represented
by circles, which indicate that there is no evidence of a nugget eﬀect. The figure
also includes the estimated semivariogram based on the exponential model without
nugget eﬀect (solid line), the Matern model without a nugget efect (black dash-dot
line) and the Spherical model (gray dotted line). The parameters of the exponential
semivariogram model without a nugget eﬀect are estimated using n-weighted least
squares and a numerical minimization algorithm in the geoR package of software
R, (Ribeiro Jr. & Diggle 2001). Notice in Figure 2 that small d have smaller error
bars than larger d. Cressie (2015) describes how a simple nonlinear least-squares
estimator would ignore the fact that the variance is a function of distance and
a weighted least-squares approach could improve model fit by allowing diﬀerent
variances. Of the three spatial correlation models the exponential model better
fit. For the exponential model σ̂ 2 = 0.034 and ϕ̂ = 3.194; for the Matern model
σ̂ 2 = 0.028, ϕ̂ = 0.167 and k = 52.791, and for the spherical model σ̂ 2 = 0.028 and
ϕ̂ = 5.

    There is no evidence of a nugget eﬀect because the empirical semivariogram
cloud approaches zero for small distances. Based on these phase I sample bottles,
the spatial control chart will use the covariance based on the exponential model
without a nugget-eﬀect. Figure 3 shows the spatial T 2 , MEWMA and MCUSUM
control charts using the exponential, Matern and spherical models to estimate the
semivariogram, where the upper control limit for the spatial T 2 is calculated as the
percentile χ20.005,8 = 21.95, the control limits for the spatial MCUSUM chart and
spatial MEWMA (λ = 0.2) chart are h = 12.7 and h = 27.2, respectively, which
are chosen by simulations to obtain an ARL0 = 200. The spatial MCUSUM chart
behaviour is similar in the three models; the same situation occurs for the spatial
T 2 and MEWMA(λ = 0.2) chart. These control charts show 2 out-of-control
signals, corresponding to the days 7 and 8.

   In this example, the three control charts show the same performance, this may
be because only 4 days are used for the estimation of parameters in phase I.

Spatial MCUSUM Control Chart                                                         65

7. Conclusions
    This paper presents a new type of MCUSUM control chart for monitoring, in
phase II, the mean of a single characteristic with spatial dependence. Under the
assumption that the observations from an isotropic stationary Gaussian process,
the control chart proposed taking account the spatial correlation that exists be-
tween the observations of the characteristic that are measured at diﬀerent sites.
This new control chart is called spatial MCUSUM. To ensure a good performance
of the proposed control chart, the assumptions of multivaraite normality, constant
variance at all location, and isotropy must be verified.
   Although the spatial MCUSUM chart constitutes an extension of the classical
multivariate cusum control chart, the control chart proposed diﬀers in three fun-
damental points: only a single quality characteristic is measured in diﬀerent sites,
the covariance matrix is estimated based on the semivariogram that takes into
account the spatial dependence, and the observations from an isotropic Gaussian
process.
    According to the simulation study, which considered only the exponential semi-
variogram, for small shifts in the mean vector the spatial MCUSUM chart has bet-
ter performance than the spatial T 2 and MEWMA control charts. For moderate
shifts in the mean vector the spatial MEWMA(λ = 0.1) presents better perfor-
mance. For large shifts the spatial T 2 (with n > 1) and MEWMA control charts
show a better performance. It would be interesting to explore the performance of
these three control charts using other semivariogram models. The performance of
the spatial MCUSUM control chart is sensitive to the distributional assumption,
although the control limit can be found by simulation to guarantee a predeter-
mined ARL in-control. More research is required to study the robustness of the
proposed spatial MCUSUM chart.
    The spatial MCUSUM control chart is based on the assumption that the pro-
cess is isotropic stationary Gaussian, therefore is important verify, in phase I, that
the spatial process satisfies the assumptions of isotropy, stationarity and normal-
ity. An user may use graphical diagnostics, such as directional sample variograms,
rose diagrams, and empirical semivariogram contour plot to decide whether the
assumption of isotropy is reasonable, or use the proposals presented by Cabaña
(1987), Maity & Sherman (2012), or Weller & Hoeting (2020) to test this hypoth-
esis. The stationarity can be verified using the proposal presented by Fuentes
(2005), for example; while the assumption of normality can be verified using the
proposals formulated by Yuan (2000) or Di Bernardino et al. (2017).
    Another interesting research topic could be the extending of this procedure for
health surveillance. The timely detection of various types of adverse health events
is very important for the agencies responsible for health surveillance. For example,
detect disease outbreaks such as asthma or influenza. The delay in the detection
of and response to an adverse health event can result in the loss of lives and high
economic costs. The early detection of these events allows preparing contingency
plans to contain them. Using the spatial information that is given by the location
can potentially enable localized outbreaks of a disease to be detected, or variations

in regional patterns to be identified (Unkel, Farrington, Garthwaite, Robertson &
Andrews 2012). The proposed spatial MCUSUM control chart could help detect
these outbreaks or changes. This extension must consider, among others, the
following observations: 1) risk adjust the outcome data before constructing a
control chart, 2) find measures appropriate to evaluate the performance of the
control proposed chart in the health care context, 3) adjust the population at
risk, which it varies over time, 4) capture the space-time dependence presents in
the data. Some interesting references on this topic are Sonesson & Bock (2003),
Woodall (2006), and Tsui, Chiu, Gierlich, Goldsman, Liu & Maschek (2008).
    It would be interesting to investigate a version of the proposed control chart
for phase I, as well as the eﬀect of the estimation in phase I on the performance
of the chart in phase II.
