Abstract
In this work, we propose a three-parameter generalized Lindley distribution using the cubic rank transmutation map approach by Granzotto et al. (2017). We derive expressions for several mathematical properties including moments and moment generating function, mean deviation, probability weighted moments, quantile function, reliability analysis, and order statistics. We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of the maximum likelihood estimation procedure for estimating model parameters. The ﬂexibility of the proposed model is illustrated by analyzing two real data sets.
Key words: cubic rank transmutation map; Lindley distribution; reliability analysis; parameter estimation.
Resumen
En este trabajo, proponemos una distribución generalizada Lindley con tres parámetros utilizando el enfoque de mapa de transmutación de rango cúbico de Granzotto et al. (2017). Derivamos expresiones para varias propiedades matemáticas, incluyendo momentos y función generadora de momentos, desviación media, momentos ponderados por probabilidad, función cuantil, análisis de conﬁabilidad y estadísticas de orden. Se realizó un estudio de simulación para evaluar el rendimiento del procedimiento de estimación de máxima verosimilitud para estimar los parámetros del modelo. La ﬂexibilidad del modelo propuesto se ilustra mediante el análisis de dos conjuntos de datos reales.
Palabras clave: análisis de ﬁabilidad; distribución Lindley; estimación de parámetros; mapa de transmutación de rango cúbico.

1. Introduction
    The Lindley distribution was developed by Lindley (1958). It has many
applications in modeling lifetime data. It is especially useful in modeling mortality
studies although it has limitations in its hazard function which only has increasing,
decreasing, unimodal, and bathtub shapes, Ghitany et al. (2011). The Lindley
distribution can be written as a mixture of exponential and gamma distributions.
However, it has superiority over the exponential distribution because of its
unimodal and bathtub-shaped hazard rates, Ghitany et al. (2008). A study of its
properties is presented by Ghitany et al. (2008). The probability density function
(PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Lindley distribution are
given by


                                         θ2
                            g(x; θ) =       (1 + x)e−θx ;                              (1)
                                        θ+1
and
                                        θ + 1 + θx −θx
                          G(x; θ) = 1 −            e
                                           θ+1
                                                 θx −θx
                                  = 1 − e−θx −       e  ;                              (2)
                                               θ+1
respectively, where x > 0, and θ > 0.
    Extensions of the Lindley distribution have been developed in literature by
adding more shape parameters to improve the ﬁtting of various data sets. Earliest
Lindley extensions include the discrete Poisson-Lindley distribution introduced
by Sankaran (1970), which was used to model data from mistakes in copying
groups of random digits with expected frequencies, and data from accidents to
women working on high explosive shells. Nadarajah et al. (2011) introduced
a generalized Lindley distribution which has better hazard rate properties than
the gamma, lognormal and the Weibull distributions. Shanker et al. (2013)
introduced a two-parameter Lindley distribution which was ﬁtted to data on
survival times of guinea pigs infected with virulent tubercle bacilli, and data
for waiting times for bank customers. Other extensions include the extended
Lindley Poisson distribution by Pararai et al. (2015), Weibull Lindley distribution
by Asgharzadeh et al. (2018), truncated Lindley distribution by Zaninetti (2019),
double Lindley distribution by Kumar & Jose (2018), and Zografos Balakrishnan
Power Lindley Distriution by Khokhar et al. (2020), among others. Motivated by
Shaw & Buckley (2007), Shaw & Buckley (2009), and Granzotto et al. (2017), we
develop a cubic rank transmuted-type distribution using the Lindley distribution
as the base distribution. This new distribution is called the cubic rank transmuted
Lindley (CRTL) distribution.
   Automation of data collection resulted in more complex data whose dynamics
cannot be captured by common one or two parameter probability distributions
which have been studied extensively in literature. Over the years, transformation
methods for random variables have been developed to build probability models

that reﬂect speciﬁc properties of the data being modeled, thus providing a better
ﬁt for the data, Gilchrist (2000). Considerable eﬀort has been expended in
the development of large classes of standard probability distributions along with
relevant statistical methodologies. However, there still remains many important
problems where the real data does not follow any of the classical or standard
probability models, Merovci & Sharma (2014). From this point of view, we have
studied an extension of the classical Lindley distribution, Lindley (1958). The main
contribution of this work is the introduction of a new distribution that outperforms
its classical base distribution as well as other distributions in applications.
   Shaw & Buckley (2007) and Shaw & Buckley (2009) proposed a new
generalization method of statistical distributions called transmutation mapping,
which is the functional composition of the CDF of one distribution with the inverse
CDF of another. The purpose of this transformation was to discover families
of parametric distributions with the ability to ﬁt to levels of third and fourth
moments that depart from those of a given base distribution. According to Shaw
& Buckley (2007) and Shaw & Buckley (2009), a random variable X is said to
have a transmuted probability distribution with the CDF F1 (x) if

                    F1 (x) = (1 + λ)G1 (x) − λG1 (x)2 , |λ| ≤ 1,                      (3)

where G1 (x) is the baseline distribution of F1 (x). The corresponding PDF of the
transmuted probability distribution is

                         f1 (x) = g1 (x)[1 + λ − 2λG1 (x)],                           (4)

where g1 (x) is the PDF of the sub-model G1 (x).
    Recent distributions in literature developed by applying these transformations
include the Kumaraswamy transmuted Pareto distribution, Chhetri, Akinsete,
Aryal & Long (2017), transmuted inverse Weibull distribution, Khan et al.
(2014), a new generalized Cauchy distribution with an application to annual one
day maximum rainfall data by Ball et al. (2021), and host of others. Many
generalizations of the transmutation map have been developed over the years.
Nofal et al. (2017) introduced the generalized transmuted-G family of distributions
by incorporating two additional shape parameters to the transmuted mapping
distribution. Alizadeh et al. (2017) also introduced a generalized transmuted
family of distributions. According to Granzotto et al. (2017), the CDF and the
PDF of a cubic rank transmuted distribution are given by

              F (x) = λ1 G(x) + (λ2 − λ1 )[G(x)]2 + (1 − λ2 )[G(x)]3 ,                (5)
               f (x) = g(x)[λ1 + 2(λ2 − λ1 )G(x) + 3(1 − λ2 )[G(x)]    2
                                                                                      (6)

respectively, where g(x) is the PDF and G(x) is the CDF of the baseline
distribution, 0 ≤ λ1 ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ λ2 ≤ 1. A more recent approach is
the higher rank transmuted (HRT-G) families of distributions developed by
Riﬃ (2019). The HRT-G family generalized the transmutation map by using
higher rank transmutation maps, which are useful in ﬁtting real data from
mixture distributions. Celik (2018) introduced the cubic rank transmuted

rank transmuted Gompertz distribution. A notable recent work is cubic rank
transmuted modiﬁed Burr III distribution by Bhatti et al. (2020).
    The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes the CRTL distribution.
Section 3 covers mathematical properties of the CRTL distribution. Section 4
covers parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
method. Section 5 covers a simulation study for the MLEs. For application
purposes, the CRTL distribution is used to model datasets for survival times
of infected guinea pigs, and failure times for the USS Halfbeak number 3 main
propulsion diesel engine data in Section 6. Finally, we provide the concluding
remarks in Section 7.

3.1. Moments and Moment Generating Function

    Moments are necessary and important in any statistical analysis, especially
in applications. They can be used to study most important features and
characteristics of a distribution (e.g., tendency, dispersion, skewness and kurtosis),

3.3. Probability Weighted Moments
    The probability weighted moments (PWMs) which were ﬁrst introduced by
Greenwood et al. (1979), are the expectations of certain functions of a random
variable and can be deﬁned for any random variable whose ordinary moments
exist. Let H(x; λ1 , λ2 , θ) be the CDF of a CRTL random variable Y . Then the
(s, k)th PWM of Y is deﬁned by

3.4. Quantiles and Random Number Generator
   We use the inverse transformation method to compute an expression for the
quantile function of the proposed model. Quantiles are the points in a distribution
that relate to the rank order of values. The q th quantile xq , 0 ≤ q ≤ 1, of the
CRTL distribution is deﬁned by

             q = P r(x ≤ xq ) = F (xq )
                         "                                                      #
                = G(xq ; θ) λ1 + (λ2 − λ1 )G(xq ; θ) + (1 − λ2 )G2 (xq ; θ)                (14)


where G(xq ; θ) = 1 − e−θxq − θ+1q e−θxq .
                                     θx

     Solving the non-linear equation (14), we obtain

and W (.) is known as the product log-function or the omega function.
    We can choose speciﬁc values of parameters θ, λ1 , λ2 , and q ∈ (0, 1), and use
the expression (15) to generate a random variable X having the CRTL distribution
(7). Furthermore, we can obtain the ﬁrst quartile, median, and the third quartile
by setting q = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 respectively in equation (15).


3.5. Reliability Analysis
   The reliability is the probability of an item not failing prior to some time t
which is deﬁned by the formula R(t) = 1 − F (t), where F (t) is the CDF of the
CRTL distribution (7).
   The hazard rate function of the CRTL can be expressed as


                   f (t)
          h(t) =
                 1 − F (t)
                   g(t, θ)[λ1 + 2(λ2 − λ1 )G(t, θ) + 3(1 − λ2 )[G(t, θ)2 ]
               =                                                                     (17)
                 1 − λ1 G(t, θ) − (λ2 − λ1 )[G(t, θ)]2 + (1 − λ2 )[G(t, θ)]3

where
                               θ2
                   g(t; θ) =      (1 + t)e−θt and
                             θ+1
                                          θt −θt
                   G(t; θ) = 1 − e−θt −      e , t > 0, θ > 0.
                                        θ+1

   The reversed hazard rate function is deﬁned by the expression


                                                 f (t; θ, λ1 , λ2 )
                           r(t; θ, λ1 , λ2 ) =                      .                (18)
                                                 F (t; θ, λ1 , λ2 )

By substituting equations (7) and (8) into equation (18), we can obtain the
reversed hazard rate function of the CRTL distribution.

4. Parameter Estimation
    In this section, we discuss the MLE method to estimate the parameters of the
CRTL distribution. Let X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn be a random sample from the CRTL
distribution with observed values x1 , x2 , . . . , xn and Θ = (θ, λ1 , λ2 )T be the
parameter vector. The likelihood function for Θ can be written as

   We can use numerical methods such as the quasi-Newton algorithm to
numerically optimize the log-likelihood function given in equation (22), to get
the MLEs of the parameters θ, λ1 , and λ2 . To compute the standard error and
the asymptotic conﬁdence interval, we use the usual large sample approximation
in which the maximum likelihood estimators for Θ can be treated as being
approximately normal. For the three-parameter CRTL distribution all second
order derivatives exist. Hence we have

5. Simulation Study
    In this section, the MLEs of the CRTL distribution parameters θ, λ1 , and λ2
are evaluated via a simulation study wherein two sets of parameters and sample
sizes are tested. The simulation is repeated 1000 times for each combination of
parameters and sample size. The estimates of θ, λ1 , and λ2 and their standard
deviations are presented in Table 1. From Table 1, we see that the expected
numerical convergence of the parameters and their standard deviations converge
to zero. Note that we used R software, R Core Team (2020) to carry out the
simulation study and to produce all graphs on this manuscript.

6. Applications
   In this section, the CRTL distribution is compared with the Lindley (L),
Transmuted Lindley (TL), Quasi Lindley (QL), Exponentiated Quasi Lindley
(EQL), and Transmuted Generalized Quasi Lindley (TGQL) distributions using
two application examples. For the ﬁrst example, these distributions are used to
model the survival times (in days) of guinea pigs infected with virulent tubercle
bacilli. The second example considers failure times for the USS Halfbeak number
3 main propulsion diesel engine.

6.1. Guinea Pigs Survival Data
    This data set consists of 72 survival times (in days) of guinea pigs infected
with virulent tubercle bacilli. The data was observed and reported by Bjerkedal
(1960). Other authors who studied this data include Shanker et al. (2016), and
Ieren & Abdullahi (2020). Preliminary analysis showed that this data is skewed
right with summary statistics minimum , ﬁrst quartile (Q1 ), median, mean, third
quartile (Q3 ), and maximum given in Table 2.

             Table 2: Descriptive statistics for guinea pigs survival data.

    The model selection is based on the measures of Akaike information criterion
(AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the consistent Akaike information
criteria (CAIC) and the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQIC):

        AIC = −2l(Θ̂) + 2q,                                BIC = −2l(Θ̂) + q ln(n),
                                                                               2qn
      HQIC = −2l(Θ̂) + 2q ln(ln(n)),                  and CAIC = −2l(Θ̂) +          ,
                                                                           n−q−1

where n is the sample size, q is the number of parameters in the model and l(Θ̂)
denotes the log-likelihood function evaluated at the MLEs.
    Here we note that the smaller the values of goodness-of-ﬁt measures the better
the ﬁt of the data. The CRTL distribution is ﬁtted to the data set. The results
are compared to the L, QL, EQL, TL, and TGQL distributions based on the
test statistics as shown in Table 3. Model parameters are estimated using the
MLE method. Results from Table 3 show that the CRTL distribution is the best
distribution for ﬁtting this data since it has the lowest negative log-likelihood, AIC,
BIC, HQIC, and CAIC test statistic values compared to the other distributions
considered in this study.

observations. The pth quantile Q̂(p) was estimated from the pth quantile of the
ﬁtted distribution and p = (r − 0.5)/n, r = 1, . . . , n. The Q-Q plots show that
the CRTL distribution provides a better ﬁt for the data, compared to the other
distributions in this study. Results from this graphical analysis agree with the
results obtained in Table 3. Thus, we conclude that the CRTL distribution is
the most appropriate of the distributions to model the guinea pigs survival data
compared to the distributions considered in this study.

6.2. USS Halfbeak Data
    The second example uses a data set from the from USS Halfbeak diesel engine
which was previously studied by Ascher & Feingold (1984), Meeker & Escobar
(1998), Pekalp et al. (2014), and Deshpande et al. (2000). This data set consists
of 71 cumulative failure times in operating hours (in thousands) to unscheduled
maintenance actions for the USS Halfbeak number 3 main propulsion diesel engine.
It is assumed that the system was observed until the 71st failure at 25518 hours,
Pekalp et al. (2014). Preliminary analysis show that this data is skewed left with
summary statistics given in Table 4.

    Figure 4 shows the Q-Q plots for the CRTL, L, QL, EQL, TL, and TGQL
distributions, each plotted against the ordered observations. The pth quantile
Q̂(p) was estimated from the pth quantile of the ﬁtted distribution as done in
example 1. Results from the Q-Q plots show that the CRTL distribution provides
a better ﬁt for the data, compared to the other distributions in this study. Overall,
we observe a close performance with the TGQL distribution in this case. This
graphical analysis also agree with the results obtained in Table 5. Therefore, we
conclude that the CRTL distribution is the most appropriate of the distributions
to model the USS halfbeak number 3 main propulsion diesel engine data compared
to the distributions considered in this study.

Cubic Rank Transmuted Lindley Distribution with Applications                             81

7. Conclusion
   In this article, we have used the Lindley distribution as the baseline distribution
and the cubic rank transmuted map approach to construct the generalized Lindley
model. The expressions for several mathematical properties including moments
and moment generating function, mean deviation, probability weighted moments,
quantile function, reliability analysis and order statistics are derived. A simulation
study is used to assess the performance of the MLEs of the parameters. We used
two real data sets to show the goodness of ﬁt of the proposed model.
