Abstract
In this paper, we consider the problem of ﬁnding optimal population designs for within-individual covariance matrices discrimination and parameter estimation in nonlinear mixed eﬀects models. A compound optimality criterion is provided, which combines an estimation criterion and a discrimination criterion. We used the D-optimality criterion for parameter estimation, which maximizes the determinant of the Fisher information matrix. For discrimination, we propose a generalization of the T -optimality criterion for ﬁxed-eﬀects models. Equivalence theorems are provided for these criteria. We illustrated the application of compound criteria with an example in a pharmacokinetic experiment.

1. Introduction
    In the application of optimal design, one of the basic assumptions is to assume
that the model used to describe a given phenomenon or process is the correct
model. In practice, however, several candidate models may exist. One way
of selecting the most appropriate model from among several candidates is by
conducting an experiment designed in such a way that the observations obtained
allow us to discriminate between the models in the best possible way. In addition,
it is useful and advantageous that this design works well for estimating selected
model parameters eﬃciently. This leads to the problem of ﬁnding the optimal
experimental conditions by using optimality criteria for both model discrimination
and model parameter estimation simultaneously.
    In the case of ﬁxed-eﬀects models, a commonly used parameter estimation
criterion is D-optimality, which maximizes the determinant of the variance-
covariance matrix of estimated parameters (Atkinson, Donev & Tobias 2007).
For models with normal errors, Atkinson & Fedorov (1975) proposed the T-
optimality criterion for discriminating between two competing-response models,
which provides the most powerful F-test for the lack of ﬁt of one model when
the other is assumed to be true. The criterion has been generalized for others
ﬁxed eﬀects models (e.g., Uciński & Bogacka, 2005). López-Fidalgo, Tommasi &
Trandaﬁr (2007) proposed the KL-optimality criterion based on the Kullback-
Leibler distance. This criterion is an extension of the T -optimality criterion
and it can be used when the rival models are nested or not, homoscedastic or
heteroscedastic, and with any error distribution. These criteria have been used
in compound criteria for model discrimination and eﬃcient parameter estimation
(Atkinson, 2008 and Tommasi, 2009).
   The nonlinear mixed-eﬀects models are particularly useful in longitudinal
studies, such as population pharmacokinetics experiments, assay analyses, and
studies of growth in which a limited number of samples can be obtained from each
individual. These models distinguish two classes of variation: random variation
among observations within a given individual (within-individual) and random
variation between-individuals (Davidian & Giltinan 1995). This separation of
variability allows the estimation of population characteristics from sparse samples
per individual in a set of subjects without requering individual estimation of
the parameters. The pattern of within-individual variability is not necessarily

homogeneous, and depending on the application and nature of the data, it is
possible to incorporate heteroscedasticity by speciﬁcation of a variance function.
In the context of mixed eﬀects models, a population experimental design is deﬁned
by the number of individuals to study and the individual designs to be performed
in the individuals (number of samples and the sampling times) (Mentré, Burtin,
Merlé, Bree, Mallet & Steimer 1995). Assuming that the response function and
the between-individuals variability model are correctly speciﬁed, it may be of
interest the problem of designing an experiment in groups of individuals with
sparse samples and diﬀerent sampling scheme, for discrimination between two
competing within-individual covariance models and parameter estimation.
    The most common approach to optimal population design is D-optimal (e.g.,
Mentré, Mallet & Baccar, 1997 and Gagnon & Leonov, 2005, among others).
To discriminate between two models, some authors proposed extensions of T-
optimality criterion (e.g., Waterhouse, Redmann, Duﬀull & Eccleston, 2005,
Vajjah & Duﬀull, 2012 and Castañeda & López-Ríos, 2016). Kuczewski,
Bogacka & Uciński (2008) proposed an extension of the T -optimality criterion
for multivariate mixed models and it can be applied directly when all individuals
are observed under the same experimental conditions. In contrast to the above
problems, the model discrimination and parameter-estimation problem have not
been developed in great detail for mixed models. Waterhouse, Redmann, Duﬀull
& Eccleston (2005) proposed the product D-optimality criterion based on the
product of the determinants of the Fisher-information matrices. For nonlinear
models, however, such designs may be less eﬃcient for discriminating than the
T -optimal designs. Therefore, alternative methods for the dual purposes of model
discrimination and parameter estimation are required.
    In this paper, we consider the problem of ﬁnding optimal population designs
for discrimination between two within-individual variance models and eﬃcient
parameter estimation. A compound optimality criterion is provided, which
combines an estimation criterion and a discrimination criterion. The parameter
estimation criterion we used is the D-optimality criterion, and for discrimination,
we propose a generalization of the T-optimality criterion for ﬁxed-eﬀects models.
Our approach can be applied to population studies for groups of individuals with
sparse samples and a diﬀerent sampling scheme, where each sampling scheme is a
point in a ﬁnite space of admissible sampling sequences.
    This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the nonlinear mixed-
eﬀects model, optimal design concepts, and D-optimum designs. In Section 3, we
derive a generalization of the T-optimality criterion, and a necessary and suﬃcient
condition for a design to be optimum is given. In Section 4, we propose a compound
criterion for discrimination and estimation and provide an equivalence theorem.
In Section 5, an illustrative example is presented. Finally, our conclusions and
further work are detailed in Section 6.

2. Model and Optimal Population Design
2.1. Model
    We assume that for each individual i in a sample of N individuals, from
a larger population, the number of diﬀerent available observations is n. Let
y i = (yi1 , . . . , yin )T be the vector of repeated measurements for the ith individual,
and ti = (ti1 , . . . , tin )T the n × 1 vector of sampling times where tij belongs
to a ﬁnite set X . It is assumed that measurements made on diﬀerent subjects
are independent. To model the relationship between y i and ti , we consider the
nonlinear mixed model (Demidenko 2004):

                     y i = f (ti , β) + Z i bi + εi , i = 1, . . . , N                   (1)

where β is a p × 1 vector of population parameters, f (ti , β) is an n × 1 vector
function, f (ti , β) = (f (ti1 , β), . . . , f (tin , β))T with f a known nonlinear function
of β, Z i is an n × q full-rank matrix of known constants, bi is a q × 1 vector
of random eﬀects associated with individual i, and εi is the n × 1 within-
individual errors vector. It is assumed that the bi are independent and normally
distributed with mean 0 and variance-covariance matrix D, and that bi and εi are
independent. It is assumed that εi ∼ Nn (0, G(ti , λ)) where G(ti , λ) is an (n × n)
matrix and is called the within-individual covariance matrix, which depends on the
parameter λ(a × 1). The matrix G takes into account the nature of the variation
among observations on a given individual and may be choosen in such a way that
reﬂects the heterogeneity of variance, the correlation structure, or both. In this
work, we assume uncorrelated observations and heterogeneous variance for the
within-individual variability, so that G(ti , λ) is a diagonal matrix with diagonal
elements Var(εij ) = g(tij , λ), where g is a variance function. We assume that the
individuals share a common within-individual covariance pattern that only varies
between them through the possibly diﬀerent values of ti , and that this does not
depend on the parameter β. The distinct elements of the parameter vector λ and
the covariance matrix D can be arranged in a single vector γ ∈ Γ ⊂ Rc of variance
parameters of dimension c = a+q(q+1)/2. Under the assumption of independence
and normality of the distributions of bi and εi , the marginal distribution of y i is
n-variate normal with mean vector and variance-covariance matrix given by

                              E(y i ) =      f (ti , β)
                           Cov(y i ) =       Z i DZ Ti + G(ti , λ)                       (2)
                                        ≡ Σ(ti , γ)

In this model, the full parameters vector to be estimated is θ = (β T , γ T )T ∈ Θ ⊂
Rd of dimension d = p + c.

and that the individuals in the same group are observed under the conditions

is a population design. The set X n is the design region, and points tk are the design
points. The collection ζN = {tk , ωk }s1 where ωk = nNk is the proportion of subjects
allocated to each group is the normalized or exact population design with weights
vector ω = (ω1 , . . . , ωs ) (Gagnon & Leonov 2005). For ﬁxed values of the total
number of individuals N and the number of sampling times n, the population
optimal design problem consists of ﬁnding the design by a choice of distinct
values for the sampling times vector t ∈ X n and values for the number subjects
assigned to vector t in such a way that the resulting design maximizes some
optimality criteria. The most commonly used optimality criteria usually depend
on the unknown model parameter. One approach is to construct locally optimal
designs, which require specifying a prior parameter estimate, then addressing the
optimization problem for this speciﬁc value (Chernoﬀ 1953). In this article, the
approximate design ζ, in which the weights ωk may be any real numbers from the
interval [0, 1], is considered. The set of points tk in the design region X n , for which
the design ζ has nonzero weights ωk , is the support set of ζ.


2.3. D-optimality Criterion
    D-optimality is the most widely used criterion for eﬃcient parameter
estimation, which determines a design ζ maximizing

                               ΦD (M (ζ, θ)) = log det M (ζ, θ)

where M (ζ, θ) is the Fisher information matrix for the population design ζ which
can be expressed as the sum of the Ps Fisher information matrix M (tk , θ) for each
group with
       h   designi tk , M (ζ, θ) =  k=1 ωk M (tk , θ). The matrix M (tk , θ) is given
          2
by −E ∂∂θ∂θ ℓ(θ;y i )
                T     , where ℓ(θ; y i ) is the log-likelihood of the vector of observation
y i for the population parameter θ. This matrix can be calculated using the general
formula for observations with normal distribution, M (tk , θ) = {Muv (tk , θ)}du,v=1
with

                              ∂f (tk , θ)T −1         ∂f (tk , θ)
        Muv (tk , θ)     =                 Σ (tk , θ)

                                                                                   

                              + tr Σ (tk , θ)                 Σ (tk , θ)                 (4)

For the class of approximate population designs Ξ, a population design ζ ∗ ∈ Ξ
with a nonsingular Fisher information matrix M (ζ, θ) is a D-optimum design for
the parameter estimation θ, if and only if ϕD (t, ζ ∗ ) ≤ 0, ∀t ∈ X n , where

3. Discrimination Between Two Within-Individual
   Variance Models
    In this section, we propose a generalization of T -optimality criterion for
discrimination between two nested within-individual variance models. The
criterion determines a design that maximize the power of likelihood ratio test
when the largest model is assumed to be the true model. Our approach can be
applied to population studies for groups of individuals with sparse samples and a
diﬀerent sampling scheme.
    Let G1 (t, λ1 ) and G2 (t, λ2 ) be two models for the within-individual variability
where one model is nested within the other. For example, if G2 is nested within
of G1 , it would mean that both models involve the same structure G(t, λ), and
the parameter space Γ2 of G2 is a subset of the parameter space Γ1 of G1 , which
is deﬁned by the imposition of κ equality constraints. In order to discriminate
between these models, we propose the following criterion: assuming that G1 is
the true model for a known parameter vector γ 01 , a locally optimum approximate
population design ζ ∗ to discriminate between G1 and G2 is such that

                                   ζ ∗ = arg max TG (ζ)                                    (6)

between G1 and G2 consider the problem of testing the hypothesis:

            H0 : G(ti , λ) = G2 (ti , λ2 ) vs H1 : G(ti , λ) = G1 (ti , λ1 )               (9)

    From this expression, the power of the likelihood ratio test for the hypotheses
(9) increases with TG (ζN ) and hence can be maximized by the choice of design ζN .
   Finally, the exact design ζN can be replaced by the corresponding approximate
design ζ, thus we obtain the TG -criterion deﬁned in (7).
    In order to provide precise conditions for checking whether a particular design
is TG -optimum, we say that a design ζ is a TG -regular design if the set
                       (                                            )

              Γ2 (ζ) = γ      e 2 (ζ) = arg min
                         e2 : γ                     ωk F (tk , γ 2 )
                                                      γ 2 ∈Γ2
                                                                k=1

is singleton; otherwise it is a TG -singular design. Hence, if ζ is a TG -regular design,
and γ                   e 2 is the unique solution of the equation
      e 2 ∈ Γ2 (ζ) then γ

    Assuming that Γ2 is a compact set and Σ2 (t, γ 2 ) is a twice continuously
diﬀerentiable in Γ2 , the equivalence theorem for TG -optimality criterion can be
formulated as follows. The proof of this theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem
1 in Castañeda & López-Ríos (2016).

      is the directional derivative of TG (ζ) at ζ in the direction of δζt = ζt − ζ,
      and ζt is the design putting all mass at the point t ∈ X n .

      the optimal design ζ ∗ .

4. DTGα -optimality Criterion
    In order to provide population designs for both discrimination and eﬃcient
parameters estimation, we propose a compound criterion based on the combination
of D-optimality for each model and TG -optimality, speciﬁcally the criteria used are:

  • Φ1 (ζ) = TG for discrimination assuming that G1 is the true model

  • Φ2 (ζ) = det M1 (ζ)1/d1 for parameter estimation θ 1

  • Φ3 (ζ) = det M2 (ζ)1/d2 for parameter estimation θ 2

where Mr (ζ) is the information matrix under the model Gr for some known θ 0r .
    We adopted the approach proposed by López (2008) which consists of
maximizing the geometric mean of the eﬃciencies for a given design ζ with respect
to each criterion, weighted by a predeﬁned constant α, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. We give
equal weighting to the estimation criteria and other weighting for discrimination.
Thus, assuming that the model G1 is the true model, we propose the following
criterion:

where C is a constant that does not depend on the design ζ. The approximate
design that maximizes the criterion (15) over the set Ξ is DTGα -optimum.
    The design criterion (15) is concave because it is a convex combination of
concave functions. Therefore, the DTGα -design criterion satisﬁes the conditions
of convex optimum design theory, and the following equivalence theorem may be
stated:

matrix Mr (ζ), r = 1, 2. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the design ζ ∗ to

5. An Example
   To illustrate the proposed criterion, we consider the data set presented
in Racine, Grieve, Fluhler & Smith (1986) on the plasma concentrations of
cadralazine in 10 German cardiac- failure patients who were observed between
2 and 32 hours after a single 30mg dose of cadralazine. We propose to ﬁt the
nonlinear mixed model shown above where only the intercept is random; thus, for
simplicity, Z i = 1 for all i. This model is
                                   yil   = f (til , β i ) + bi + εil
                                           D
                          f (til , β i ) =     exp(−β2 til )                            (18)
                                           β1
where bi is the random eﬀect associated with individual i. We assume that
bi ∼ N (0, ψ) and εi ∼ Nn (0, G(ti , λ)). Thus, the full parameters vector to be
estimate is θ = (β T , γ T )T where β = (β1 , β2 )T and γ = (ψ, λT )T .
   We consider two alternative models for the within-individual covariance matrix
G(ti , λ):

 (1) Exponential model
               G1 (ti , λ) = σ 2 diag(exp(δti1 ), . . . , exp(δtin )), λ = (σ 2 , δ)T

                Revista Colombiana de Estadística - Theoretical Statistics 43 (2020) 127–141

136                                  María Eugenia Castañeda-López & Víctor Ignacio López-Ríos


 (2) Constant variance: G2 (ti , λ) = σ 2 I n , λ = σ 2 .


We ﬁt the model (18) with each within-individual covariance structure in R
Development Core Team (2014) using the nlme function for ﬁtting nonlinear
mixed-eﬀects models (Pinheiro & Bates 2000). The results of the estimation are:

              β̂ 1      =       (14.93, 0.21)T , ψ̂1 = 0.232 , σ̂12 = 0.082 , δ̂ = 0.02            (19)
                                                      T
              β̂ 2      =       (15.01, 0.19)                         2
                                                          , ψ̂2 = 0.20 , σ̂22 = 0.102


    Since the model G2 is nested within G1 , the true model is G1 . We use the
estimates of the parameters obtained previously as the local value of θ to ﬁnd the
locally optimal designs. Thus,

                                      T         T
                                                     T
               θ 01     =           β 01 , λ01            = (14.93, 0.21, 0.232 , 0.082 , 0.02)T

                                                     T
               θ 02     =           β 02 , λ02            = (15.01, 0.19, 0.202 , 0.102 )T


      The times in X was taken of the set of measurement times for the experiment:

                                           X = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24} hours

We assume that two observations are available for each patient n = 2, which is
a sparse sampling situation in a pharmacokinetic study. Therefore, the design
region is given by the set of combinations of two sampling times from X ; that is,
X 2 = {t = (t1 , t2 ); tj ∈ X } contains 15 elements. The DTGα -optimum design was
calculated to optimize the respective criterion implemented through an algorithm
in R Development Core Team (2014) for diﬀerent values of α (0.25, 0.50, 0.75).
The function nlminb was used for the optimization in the design region X 2 .
Additionally we ﬁnd the D-, TG , and product D-optimum designs (ζP∗ ) to obtain
an overview of the individual designs. The computing times took approximately 1
hour for the compound designs. The computation complexity depends on the size
of the design region and the number of parameters.
      The designs obtained were:

    To check the optimality of the calculated compound designs, we use the
Equivalence Theorem. First, we enumerate all candidate sampling sequences
(i.e., the elements of X 2 ) and calculate the sensitivity function for each sampling
sequence. Then, we plot the sensitivity function as a function of index i. The
resulting plot for each design is shown in Figure 1.

optimum designs for parameter estimation. The TG -optimum design does not seem
good for estimation purposes; for the G2 especially, the eﬃciency is approximately
38%. On the other hand, the eﬃciencies of ζP - and DTGα -optimal designs are
always high; the worst eﬃciency (α = 0.75) is approximately 62%. The third
column presents the eﬃciencies of the optimum designs with respect to the TG -
optimum design, which measure the goodness of a design for model discrimination.
For the DTGα -optimal designs, these eﬃciencies seem good; the lowest eﬃciency
(α = 0.25) is approximately 78%. The product-optimum design does not seem to
be good for discrimination purposes; the eﬃciency is approximately 44%. Thus,
the best strategy for both parameter estimation and model discrimination purposes
seems to be the DTGα -optimality criterion. In order to choose an adequate value
α to successfully discrimination and estimation, we compute the eﬃciencies for
D- and TG -optimality for diﬀerent values of α. Figure 2 graphically displays
these eﬃciencies. For α approximately 0.3, the eﬃciencies are high; therefore, the
compound design DTG0.3 is good for discriminating and estimating.

6. Conclusions
    In this article, a compound optimality criterion for model discrimination and
parameter estimation was proposed for two nonlinear mixed eﬀects nested models
with respect to the within-individual variance pattern. We used the D-optimality
criterion for estimation, and we proposed a generalization of T-optimality criterion
(the TG -optimality criterion) for the problem of model discrimination. An
equivalence theorem for the criterion was provided. To illustrate the use of
proposed methodology, a pharmacokinetic example was presented. To show the
good properties of the optimum compound design, the D-, TG - and product
D-optimum designs were computed; for discrimination, the eﬃciencies of the
compound optimum designs were higher than the D- and product D-optimal
designs. The design eﬃciencies for diﬀerent values of the weight in the compound
design α show that the design for α = 0.3 is good for estimating and discriminating.
Further development of the method for estimating the model parameters, some
nonlinear functions of parameters, and simultaneously discrimination between
models would also be interesting. In this work, we considered nonlinear mixed
model with normality of both within-subject random error and random-eﬀects,
however, there is often interest in models with nonnormal distribution. Thus, the
KL-optimality criterion could be an interesting methodology to explore in this
class of models. Finally, it should be noted that we have found local designs, but
the other option is the use of the Bayesian approach.
