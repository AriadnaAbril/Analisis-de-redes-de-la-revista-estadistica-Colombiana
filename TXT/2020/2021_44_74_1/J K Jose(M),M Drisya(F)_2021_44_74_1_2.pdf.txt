Abstract
The time-dependent stress-strength reliability models deal with systems whose strength or the stress imposed on it or both are time-dependent. In this paper, we consider time-dependent stress-strength reliability model which is subjected to constant stress and it causes a change in the strength of the system over each run of the system. Assuming a continuous phase-type distribution for the initial strength and exponential distribution for the duration of each run of the system called cycle time we derived the expression for the stress-strength reliability of the system at time t. The model is further extended to the cases where cycle time distribution is Gamma and Weibull. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the variations in stress-strength reliability, R(t) at diﬀerent time points, corresponding to the changes in the initial strength distribution and cycle time distribution.

Resumen
Los modelos de conﬁabilidad tensión-resistencia dependientes del tiempo tratan con sistemas cuya fuerza o el estrés que se le impone o ambos dependen de tiempo. En este artículo, consideramos modelos de conﬁabilidad de resistencia-tensión dependientes del tiempo que está sometido a un estrés constante y provoca un cambio en la fuerza del sistema después de cada ejecución del sistema. Asumiendo una fase continua distribución de tipo para la fuerza inicial y distribución exponencial para la duración de cada ejecución del sistema llamado tiempo de ciclo que obtuvimos la expresión de la ﬁabilidad tensión-resistencia del sistema en el tiempo t. El modelo se amplía aún más a los casos en los que la distribución del tiempo de ciclo es Gamma y Weibull. Se realizan estudios de simulación para evaluar las variaciones en la conﬁabilidad tensión-resistencia, R(t) en diferentes puntos de tiempo, correspondiente a los cambios en la distribución y el ciclo de la fuerza inicial distribución del tiempo.

1. Introduction
    Stress-strength models are of special importance in reliability theory. It deals
with the evaluation of the probability that the strength of a component of a system
exceeds the stress imposed on that component. Thus if X and Y represent the
stress applied on the system and the strength of the system respectively, then the
stress-strength reliability of the system is given by R = P [X < Y ]. This model
was introduced by Birnbaum (1956) and after that several researchers studied
the estimation of R under various assumptions on the distribution of stress and
strength. A detailed discussion of the computation of stress-strength reliability
and various inference methods of R is given in Kotz & Pensky (2003). Assuming
that stress and strength are independent random variables following diﬀerent
probability distributions Baklizi (2008), Kundu & Raqab (2009), Rezaei et al.
(2010), Wong (2012), Huang et al. (2012), Rao, (2012; 2014), Kizilaslan & Nadar
(2015), Ghitany et al. (2015), Jose et al. (2019) and Xavier & Jose (2020) have
discussed the problem of estimating R for single and multi-component systems.
    In a random period of time, if a system is subjected to repeated stress it
will induce a change in the distribution of strength of the system over time.
Stress-strength reliability models with stress or strength or both having dynamic
characteristic are called dynamic or time-dependent stress-strength reliability
models. Yadav (1973) and Gopalan & Venkateswarlu (1982; 1983) had studied
several time-dependent models. An example of a deteriorating multi-component
system is our mobile phone. Many often we may have to download ﬁles to mobile
phones. Each ﬁle consumes the memory space of the phone corresponding to the
size of that ﬁle. It causes a reduction in the speed of functioning of the phone. So
each time we download a new ﬁle, there is an increase in the number of ﬁles piled
up in the phone memory and a reduction in the functioning speed of the phone.
   Here, we consider the stress-strength reliability model in which the system is
subject to constant stress and it causes a change in the strength of the system
over time. We assume that the strength of the system reduces by a constant
over each run of the system, and is called random ﬁxed strength and the time for
completion of the run is called cycle time. The system fails whenever the stress
imposed exceeds its strength. The stress-strength reliability of the dynamic system
changes with respect to time. So in the case of dynamic or time-dependent stress-

strength model, we are interested in the estimation of stress-strength reliability at
time t,
                                R(t) = P [X(t) < Y (t)],                                 (1)
where X(t) and Y (t) represent the stress on the system and strength of the system
at time t respectively.
    A real-life system will always have some strength. When stress is applied to
the system continuously, its strength will change and the stress-strength reliability
measures the chance of further functioning of the system. For instance, suppose
that an individual is a smoker. When he smokes, tobacco will burn and a toxic
chemical particle called cigarette tar will be left behind. Whenever the person
inhales the cigarette smoke, tar builds up inside the lungs. With the accumulation
of tar, the color of the lungs will be converted to dark and eventually the tar can
kill cilia in the lungs, which helps to trap pollutants. When cilia get damaged,
the tar travels deeper into the lungs. From the lungs, it can move to other parts
of the body. It can aﬀect every organ in the body and can cause diseases like
cancer, heart disease, etc. So when he smokes over time, there will be an increase
in accumulation of tar and simultaneously a decrease in healthy cilia.
    Siju & Kumar (2016; 2017) estimated time-dependent stress-strength reliability
of the models with random ﬁxed strength and ﬁxed stress assuming Weibull
distribution for initial strength and cycle time distribution as exponential. In this
paper, we consider the estimation of the stress-strength reliability function R(t) of
the time-dependent models with cycle time distribution as exponential, Gamma
or Weibull. The system is subjected to a constant stress and the distribution of
the initial strength is continuous phase-type distribution.
   There are several motivations for using phase-type distribution in reliability
analysis. They constitute a very versatile class of distributions deﬁned on the
non-negative real numbers that lead to models which are algorithmically tractable.
Hence they play an important role as a computational vehicle of much of applied
probability. For a detailed discussion on phase-type distribution one may refer
to Neuts (1975). Asmussen et al. (1996) introduced expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm for ﬁtting phase-type distribution. Expectation Maximization
uniformization (EM unif) algorithm was developed by Bladt et al. (2011) as an
improvement over EM algorithm.
    Consider a continuous time Markov chain {Xt , t ≥ 0} on a discrete state space
with a ﬁnite number of states (m + 1), of which (m + 1)th state is absorbing and
states 1, 2, . . . , m are transient. Suppose that the generator matrix of the chain is
                                           (        )
                                             B tB
                                       Q=
                                             0 0
where the diagonal elements of the matrix B say Bii ≤ 0; i ≤ m and the non
diagonal elements of the matrix say Bij ≥ 0 for i ̸= j, with Be + tB = 0, where e
is an m × 1 column vector of unity and 0 is the 1 × m zero matrix.
   Let βi = P [X(0) = i] denote the initial probability. Hence the initial
probability vector of {X(t), t ≥ 0} is given by (β, βm+1 ) where β = (β1 , β2 , . . . , βm )
and βe + βm+1 = 1.

   A continuous phase-type (CPH) distribution is deﬁned as the distribution of
time to get absorbed to the absorbing state of a CTMC. If Z is a CPH random
variable, then its probability density function (pdf) is deﬁned as
                               f (z) = βeBz tB ; z ≥ 0                                 (2)
where tB = −Be and we write as Z ∼ CP H(β, B)m . The set of parameters (β, B)
is said to be a representation of the CPH distribution. The dimension of B is said
to be the order of the representation.
    Several standard statistical distributions like exponential distribution, erlang
distribution, generalized erlang distribution and hyper-exponential distribution
can be obtained as special cases of CPH distribution. The class of CPH distribution
possesses several interesting closure properties which makes it a good choice
for modelling many characteristics. Most of these results are well established
in Neuts (1975).
    Many authors have considered deteriorating complex multi-component
manufacturing systems whose failure times, lifetimes or repair times follow
phase-type distribution. Barron et al. (2004) analyzed an R-out-of-N repairable
system assuming the lifetimes of components follow phase-type distribution.
Barron & Yechiali (2017) dealt with deteriorating repairable Markovian system
consisting of stochastically independent and identical units following discrete
phase-type distribution (DPH). Eryilmaz (2018) considered CPH distribution as
the distributions of stress and strength and studied stress-strength reliability for
a single unit and multi-component systems. Jose et al. (2020) estimated stress-
strength reliability for a single unit and multi-component systems assuming DPH
as the distributions of stress and strength components.
    This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we brieﬂy describe the stress-
strength reliability of time-dependent model with cycle time following exponential
distribution, constant stress and random-ﬁxed strength. In sections 3 and 4,
the model is extended to the case in which the cycle time distribution follows
Gamma distribution and Weibull distribution respectively. Section 5 deals with
the EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of CPH distribution. In section 6,
simulation studies are conducted to assess the variations in R(t) corresponding to
the changes in the initial strength distribution and cycle time distribution. Section
7 deals with the concluding remarks.


2. Estimation of R(t) with Cycle Time Follows
   Exponential Distribution
   Consider a system which is allowed to run continuously within an interval of
time. The initial strength of the system is assumed to follow CPH distribution
and the stress on the system over the entire time interval is assumed to be ﬁxed.
Let x0 be the stress applied on the system throughout the time interval (0, t) and
Y0 be the initial strength of the system. The distribution of Y0 is CP H(β, B)p
with p.d.f.,
                            fY0 (y0 ) = βeBy0 tB ; y0 ≥ 0.                      (3)

Stress-Strength Reliability Estimation of Tim-Dependent Model                            205

    Strength of the system is assumed to be decreasing over each run by a constant
a0 . Let Xi denote the stress acting on the system during the ith cycle time and
Yi be the corresponding strength of the system. Then probability of functioning
of the system after n runs is given by
         Rn = P [(X1 < Y1 ) ∩ (X2 < Y2 ) ∩ · · · ∩ (Xn < Yn )]
             = P [(x0 < Y0 − a0 ) ∩ (x0 < Y0 − 2a0 ) ∩ · · · ∩ (x0 < Y0 − na0 )]
                                                                                         (4)
             = P [(x0 + na0 < Y0 )]
          = βeB(x0 +na0 ) e′p
          (                   )
where ep = 1 1 · · · 1 1×p .
   Now, assume that the cycle time has exponential distribution with rate λ, so
that N (t), the number of runs during an interval of time (0, t) follows Poisson
process. Hence the probability of n runs within (0, t) is given by

                                                e−λt (λt)n
                                   Pn (t) =                .                             (5)
                                                   n!
Therefore, the value of R(t) can be obtained as
                                   ∞
                                   ∑

                                                  ∞
                                                  ∑ (λt)n
                               = e−λt βeBx0                    eBna0 e′p
                                                 n=0
                                                        n!

                               =e

   Now we consider the special case where the cycle time distribution is
exponential with rate λ and the distribution of initial strength of the system is
exponential with rate θ. Then
                                                         −θa0
                                R(t) = e−θx0 −λt(1−e             )
                                                                     .                   (7)

Similarly, when the cycle time distribution is exponential with rate λ and the
distribution of initial strength of the system is hyper-exponential with rate
parameters θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θs and mixing parameters p1 , p2 , . . . , ps respectively, then
                                     ∑
                                     s

                            R(t) =         pi e−θi x0 −λt(1−e            )
                                                                             .           (8)
                                     i=1

    If the initial strength distribution is a ﬁnite mixture of independent
distributions, we have the following result.

time distribution is exponential, then the stress-strength reliability function of the
system is

distribution and initial strength distribution are given in Figures 1, 2 and 3. In
all the case, R(t) value increases with a decrease in the value of the cycle time
parameter.

3. Estimation of R(t) with Cycle Time Follows
   Gamma Distribution
  In the previous section, we assumed that cycle time distribution is exponential.
Now, we consider more general case in which we assume that the cycle times follows
Gamma distribution with p.d.f.,

Then the number of runs during the time interval (0, t) has the distribution,

    If the initial strength distribution is a ﬁnite mixture of independent
distributions, we have the following result.
    Result 2. Consider a single component system subject to a ﬁxed stress x0 ,
and initial strength distribution follows a ﬁnite mixture of continuous probability

where Ri (t) is the stress-strength reliability function of the system with initial
strength distribution is f (yi ), ﬁxed stress x0 , and cycle time distribution is
Gamma.
    Figures 4, 5 and 6 represent the variation in R(t) with respect to distinct
parameter values of cycle time and initial strength distributions, when the cycle
times are Gamma random variables. Here also the value R(t) decreases with an
increase in time, as in the case of exponential cycle times.

The corresponding c.d.f. has the form

Then the number of runs during the time interval (0, t) is a Weibull renewal
process.
   Let t1 , t2 , . . . denote the time at which renewal take place. Sn = t1 +t2 +· · ·+tn
be the total time up to the instant of nth renewal. Then the distribution of Sn , is
given by

   Let Pn (t) denote the probability of n renewals in (0, t), which is deﬁned as

ηn (i) are bounded by 2i(n+1) and hence Pn (t) is absolutely convergent. Note that

   Therefore, using equation (6), the reliability of the system at time t with
constant stress and random ﬁxed strength following CPH distribution and Weibull
cycle time distribution can be obtained as

    If the initial strength distribution is a ﬁnite mixture of independent

and initial strength distribution follows a ﬁnite mixture of continuous probability

where Ri (t) is the stress-strength reliability function of the system with initial
strength distribution f (yi ), ﬁxed stress x0 , and cycle time distribution is Weibull.
   Figure 7 represents the variation in R(t) with respect to distinct parameter
values of cycle time and initial strength distributions, when the cycle times
are Weibull random variables. From Figure 7, we can see that the value of
R(t) decreases with increase in strength parameter values as well as cycle time
parameter values.


5. ML Estimation of Parameters of CPH
   Distribution
    We have used EM uniformization algorithm for estimating the parameters of
initial strength distribution. While dealing with phase-type random variables,
we will only have the absorption times, and the entire underlying structure of the
Markov process is not available. Asmussen et al. (1996) have presented a procedure
for ﬁtting CPH distributions via the EM algorithm. Using uniformization method,
Bladt et al. (2011) developed an alternative method to compute the E-step in the
EM algorithm, and is called as EM unif algorithm.
     Let {y1 , y2 , . . . , yM } be a sample of size M from CP H(β, B), then
{y1 , y2 , . . . , yM } denote the time until absorption. Assume that we have complete
observation of a Markov jump process with p states, {X(t), t ≥ 0}. Consider y
∈ {y1 , y2 , . . . , yM } and suppose that k jumps takes place before absorption. Let
x0 , x1 , . . . , xm be the sequence of states visited and the time taken between each

    We have to ﬁnd the MLE of Γ = (β, B, t) of CP H(α, A) using the observed data
{y1 , y2 , . . . , yM }. Let uk = (xk0 , xk1 , . . . , xkm ) denote the trajectory of the underlying
Markov jump processes(MJPs) {X(t), t ≥ 0} corresponding to the observation yk
and u = {uk ; k = 1, 2, . . . , M } gives the full data set for the M absorption times.
    Let Bk represent the number of processes that start from state k, Nk be the
number of processes which exit from state k to the absorbing state, Nkl be the
number of jumps from k th state to lth state among all processes, and Zk be the
total time spent in the state k before absorption for all processes. Let Bkm , Zkm , Nkm
         m
and Nkl       be the corresponding statistics for the mth observation. The likelihood
function of the complete data is

   Bladt et al. (2011) replaced the constant unit of time between two transitions by
independent exponential random variables with the same parameter and interprets
a continuous time Markov process as a discrete time Markov chain. The EM unif
algorithm is given below.

      Step1.Set Γ0 = (β0 , B0 , tB0 ), initial value of the parameters.
      Step 2.(E-step): Calculate the function r(Γ) = EΓ0 (lf (Γ; x) | Y = y)
      Step 3.(M-step): Γ0 = argmaxΓ r(Γ)
      Step 4. Goto step 2.
      The E-step and M-step are repeated until convergence.


6. Numerical Analysis
    In this section, we carry out Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the estimation
of the value of R(t) of the time-dependent system with ﬁxed stress, random cycle
times and random ﬁxed initial strength distributions. Here we consider three
examples. In the ﬁrst example consider the system with exponential cycle time
distribution so that the number of cycles have Poisson process, in the second
example we consider the system with Gamma cycle time distribution so that
the number of cycles have Gamma renewal process and in the third example we
consider the system with Weibull cycle time distribution so that the number of
cycles have Weibull renewal process.
    In each case we have simulated 10,000 observations each on cycle time and
initial strength. The parameters of the models are estimated by ML method using
the simulated data sets. The entire procedure is repeated 2,000 times and obtained
the bootstrap lower conﬁdence interval (LCI) of R(t), at diﬀerent time points, by
using the estimates of R(t) corresponding to ﬁrst 1,000 samples. The remaining
1,000 simulated samples are used for computing the coverage probability (CP).

The distribution of Z is called k-generalized erlang distribution.

    Assume that the cycle time distributions as exponential with parameter λ = 0.1
and initial strength distribution as generalized erlang with parameters 2, 0.1 and
0.5. The value of the stress is taken as x0 = 10 and the strength reducing constant
as a0 = 6. We have simulated 10,000 observations from exp(λ) and GE(2,0.1,0.5).
   Using the simulated data, estimated the cycle time distribution parameter and
parameters of the initial strength distribution. The estimated values are given
in Table 1. The graph of the histograms corresponding to the simulated data on
cycle times, number of runs during the time interval (0, t) and initial strength
along with the actual distribution are given in Figure 8.

    The bootstrap lower conﬁdence interval (LCI) of R(t) at time points t = 10,
50, 100 and the corresponding coverage probabilities are given in Table 2. The
histograms corresponding to the sampling distribution of R(t) at t = 10, t = 50
and t = 100 are given in Figure 9.
Example 2. In this example we took the cycle time distribution as Gamma. So
that the number of runs during the time interval (0, t) follows a renewal process.
Consider the parameters of cycle time distribution as k = 1 and a = 0.1. We took
the initial strength distribution as exponential with parameter θ = 0.01.

    The value of stress is ﬁxed as x0 = 2 and the strength reducing constant as
a0 = 0.28. We have estimated the parameters of cycle time distribution, initial
strength distribution and R(t) using the simulated data. The estimated values are
given in Table 3. The graph of the histograms corresponding to the simulated data
on cycle times, number of runs during the time interval (0, t) and initial strength
along with the actual distribution are given in Figure 10.

Example 3. Here we assume that the distribution of cycle times as Weibull with
shape parameter value c = 1.5 and the distribution of initial strength as hyper-
exponential with parameter p1 = 0.2, p2 = 0.8, θ1 = 0.3, θ2 = 0.5. The value of
the stress is taken as x0 = 0.005 and the strength reducing constant as a0 = 0.001.

   Let X1 , X2 , . . . , Xk are k independent exponential random variables with
parameters λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk respectively. Assume that Z takes the value of xi with

and is called hyper - exponential distribution. Then Z ∼ P H(β, B), where

7. Conclusion
   In this paper, we considered time dependent stress-strength reliability model
subjected to constant stress. The stress causes a change in the strength of the
system during each run of the system. R(t) is estimated under the assumption
that the initial strength has CPH distribution and the cycle times have either
exponential, Gamma or Weibull distribution. We have obtained the expression
of R(t) for identical systems connected in series as well as parallel conﬁguration

when the cycle times follow an exponential distribution. Variation in R(t) with
respect to time is studied for various cases of systems with cycle times following
exponential, Gamma and Weibull distribution. ML estimates, bootstrap lower
conﬁdence intervals and corresponding coverage probability are also obtained for
R(t) at diﬀerent points of time.
