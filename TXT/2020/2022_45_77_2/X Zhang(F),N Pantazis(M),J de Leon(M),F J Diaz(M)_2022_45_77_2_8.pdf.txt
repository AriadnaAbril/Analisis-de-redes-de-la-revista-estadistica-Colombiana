Abstract
Electronic health records (EHR) provide valuable resources for longitudinal studies and understanding risk factors associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, they may not contain complete follow-ups, and the missing data may not be at random since hospital discharge may depend in part on expected but unrecorded clinical outcomes that occur after patient discharge. These non-ignorable missing data requires appropriate analysis methods. Here, we are interested in measuring and analyzing individual treatment benets of medical treatments in patients recorded in EHR databases. We present a method for predicting individual benets that handles non-ignorable missingness due to hospital discharge. The longitudinal clinical outcome of interest is modeled simultaneously with the hospital length of stay using a joint mixed-eects model, and individual benets are predicted through a frequentist approach: the empirical Bayesian approach. We illustrate our approach by assessing individual pain management benets to patients who underwent spinal fusion surgery. By calculating sample percentiles of empirical Bayes predictors of individual benets, we examine the evolution of individual benets over time. We additionally compare these percentiles with percentiles calculated with a Monte Carlo approach. We showed that empirical Bayes predictors of individual benets do not only allow examining benets in specic patients but also reect overall population trends reliably.

Resumen
Los registros de salud electr√≥nicos (RSE) suministran recursos valiosos para estudios longitudinales y para comprender los factores de riesgo asociados con pobres resultados cl√≠nicos. Sin embargo, estos podr√≠an no contener seguimientos completos, y los datos faltantes podr√≠an no ser al azar, debido a que el alta hospitalaria puede depender en parte de resultados cl√≠nicos esperados pero no registrados que ocurren despu√©s de dar de alta al paciente. Esta ausencia de datos no ignorables requiere m√©todos apropiados de an√°lisis. Aqu√≠ estamos interesados en medir y analizar benecios individuales de tratamientos m√©dicos en pacientes consignados en bases de datos RSE. Proponemos un m√©todo para predecir benecios individuales el cual maneja los datos faltantes debidos al alta hospitalaria. La respuesta cl√≠nica longitudinal de inter√©s se modela junto con el tiempo de estad√≠a en el hospital usando un modelo conjunto de efectos mixtos, y los benecios individuales se predicen por medio de un enfoque frecuentista: el enfoque Bayesiano emp√≠rico. Nuestro enfoque es ilustrado evaluando los benecios individuales del tratamiendo para el dolor en pacientes que fueron sometidos a cirug√≠a de fusi√≥n espinal. Aqu√≠ examinamos la evoluci√≥n de los benecios individuales a trav√©s del tiempo mediante el c√°lculo de los percentiles muestrales de los predictores de Bayes emp√≠ricos de los benecios individuales. Tambi√©n comparamos estos percentiles con percentiles calculados mediante un enfoque Monte Carlo. Los resultados mostraron que los predictores de Bayes emp√≠ricos de benecios individuales no s√≥lo permiten examinar benecios en pacientes espec√≠cos sino que tambi√©n reejan conablemente las tendencias poblacionales globales.

1. Introduction
   It is increasingly recognized that a patient's response to a medical treatment is a
statistically heterogeneous phenomenon (de Leon, 2012). Average treatment eects
may not accurately represent a heterogeneous population of patients (Ruberg
et al. 2010; Gewandter et al. 2019). The benets each patient receives from the
treatment could dier; which implies that treatment benets should be measured
at the patient level (Diaz 2016; 2019; 2021; Zhang et al. 2020; Wang & Diaz 2020).
Generalized linear mixed-eects models allow identifying the various sources of
variation of patients' responses (Andrews & Cho 2018; Botts et al.            2008; Cho
et al. 2017; Diaz & de Leon 2013; Diaz et al. 2007; 2008; 2012a; 2012b; 2013; 2014;
Diaz 2018; Senn 2016; Zhu & Qu 2016; Shirafkan et al. 2020), oering an excellent
tool for analyzing individual benets and applications in personalized medicine.
In the context of clinical trials, Diaz (2016) has proposed a methodology based
on mixed models that allows quantifying and analyzing the individual benets of
medical treatments. He denes an individual benet as the reduction in disease
severity produced by the treatment, whereas disease severity is dened as the
probability that the clinical outcome of interest is outside of the therapeutic
target. Individual benets are thus measured on a probability scale. In practice,
to assess the benets of a treatment for a specic patient, empirical Bayes (EB)
predictors of the individual benets are calculated. This frequentist approach has
been implemented with both continuous (Diaz, 2019) and binary (Zhang et al.,
2020) clinical outcomes and has been proposed as the foundation of treatment
individualization methods in N-of-1 clinical trials (Diaz, 2021).

   It is also recognized that real-world data such as electronic health records
(EHR) collected in a non-randomized setting hold critical value for clinical
evidence generation and play a complementary role to clinical trial data (Miksad
& Abernethy, 2018).      EHR data provide longitudinal follow-up for patient's
outcomes. One limitation of EHR data, however, is that there is usually incomplete
follow-up due to hospital discharge.    Since hospital discharge often depends on
the patient's response, non-recorded responses after discharge are nonignorable
missing data (Little & Rubin 2002; Pantazis & Touloumi 2010; Albers et al.
2018). This creates a problem for building models to predict treatment benets
because generalized mixed eects models assume missingness at random (Hedeker
& Gibbons 2006; Laird 1998). When the missingness is non-ignorable, statistical
analyses with these models may be seriously biased if the model does not
appropriately incorporate the variable causing the missingness (Touloumi et al.,
1999).

   This study has three objectives.     The rst is to extend the methodology for
measuring and analyzing individual treatment benets proposed by Diaz (2016;
2019; 2021) to longitudinal hospital data with non-ignorable missingness.            The
second objective is to illustrate the methodology with a detailed data analysis


                                                                             ¬Æ
of the individual benets of postoperative pain management in 330 patients who
underwent spinal fusion surgery, using EHR data (Cerner HealthFacts              ; Kansas
City, MO). In our data analysis, we examine estimates of population percentiles of
individual benets to understand population time trends using sample percentiles

of EB predictions of individual benets.       The third objective is to compare our
approach based on EB predictors with an alternative approach based on Monte
Carlo approximations to the probability distribution of the individual benets.
The goal of this comparison is to illustrate that, in addition to allowing measuring
the individual benets to specic patients, EB predictors allow representing the
estimated overall population trends (Zhang et al., 2020).

      Here, we propose to analyze individual treatment benets with hospital data by
jointly modeling the patients' responses to the medical treatment and their hospital
length of stay (LOS). LOS is also called patient's discharge time.           Joint mixed-
eects models that combine a generalized linear mixed eects model with a survival
model have been used to handle longitudinal clinical trial data with informative
drop-outs that produce non-ignorable missings (Schluchter 1992; De Gruttola &
Tu 1994; Touloumi et al. 1999; Pantazis & Touloumi 2010; Crowther et al. 2012;
Armero et al.     2018; Hickey et al.    2018; Shardell & Ferrucci 2018; Schluchter
& Piccorelli 2019; Papageorgiou et al.       2019).   In particular, Touloumi, Pocock,
Babiker & Darbyshire (1999) developed a method of parameter estimation for joint
models that combines restricted iterative generalized least-squares with a nested
expectation-maximization algorithm.        To our knowledge, these models have not
been used to model hospital data, which are unavoidably biased by non-ignorable
missingness due to the dependence of hospital discharge on the patient's response.

      This study was motivated by the fact that many outcomes of clinical procedures
and pharmacological therapies, as well as patient-reported outcomes recorded in
longitudinal EHR data are associated with hospital LOS. For instance, laboratory
results such as biological markers of acute myocardial infarction (Gronski et al.,
2012) or acute kidney injury (Edelstein, 2008), as well as physical or behavioral
scores (Shaw et al., 2018), are often measured only during hospital stay and are
used in discharge planning and decision making.             Another example is patients'
self-reported measurements of pain scores to monitor the eectiveness of a surgical
procedure, which are available before surgery, or during the hospital stay after the
surgery, but are no longer recorded after discharge.

      Here, we apply our novel benet analysis methodology to the quantication and
comparison of individual benets of postoperative pain management. We evaluate
the eects of depression and geriatric age (age > 65 years) on patient-reported pain
levels. Although lumbar spinal fusion is the top treatment for chronic low back
pain and the second most common lower back operation overall, we need a better
understanding of how patients' characteristics inuence postoperative outcomes
(Gaudin et al.     2017; Gerbershagen et al.       2014).    Depression is known to be
associated with chronic pain such as back pain and is a negative predictor of spinal
fusion outcomes (Gaudin et al., 2017). Retrospective cohort studies have found
that: 1) patients with pre-existing depression were absent from work for more days
after spinal fusion surgery compared to those without depression (Anderson et al.,
2015), and 2) preoperative depression inuences patient satisfaction independent of
the surgery's eectiveness (Adogwa et al., 2013). Patient-reported maximum pain
levels on a scale from 0 to 10 are often used as postoperative quality measures to
monitor pain relief and track patients' progress after spinal fusion. Studies of risk
factors for severe postoperative pain have provided varying results. The risk factors

could be procedure-specic; however, preoperative chronic pain and younger age
were associated with higher postoperative pain level independent of the type and
extent of the surgery in pooled data from 150 German hospitals (Gerbershagen
et al., 2014). In a German registry of knee replacement, older age was associated
with lower reported maximum pain levels. On the other hand, the elderly patients
did not report less functional impairment caused by pain, suggesting that they
tend to underreport their pain levels (Weinmann et al., 2017).




2. Methods
2.1. Joint Model for Observational Longitudinal Continuous
     Outcomes with Non-ignorable Missingness
    Next, we describe a joint multivariate random eects model that simultaneously
models a continuous clinical outcome and the hospital LOS. In the application
presented in this article, the outcome is a transformed self-reported pain score
from patients who underwent lumbar spinal fusion surgery. In general, we assume
that we have data from N patients that underwent a medical treatment in the
hospital and that we want to measure the individual benets of the treatment for
each patient after t days on treatment.            Suppose patient i provided ni outcome
measurements on days ti,1           < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < ti,ni counted from treatment initiation. In
our application, day 0 is the day of the surgery and treatment refers to pain
                                           ‚àó                           T
management after surgery. Let y i  = (yi1 , . . . , yini ) be a vector containing the
outcome measurements for patient i in time order, where yi1 is assumed to be
measured right before treatment (the baseline measure at day 0), and yij , j > 1,
is measured after treatment initiation.
                                                                                            T
    For patient i, let xi (t) = (g0 (t) , g1 (t) , . . . , gK (t) , xi,1 , . . . , xi,p ) be a vector
of covariates corresponding to time t, where g0 (t), g1 (t), . . . , gK (t) are functions of
time and xi,1 , . . . , xi,p are patient-level covariates (i.e, patient's characteristics).
Let z(t) be a vector containing some or all the functions g0 (t), g1 (t),. . . , gK (t).
Denote xij = xi (tij ) and z ij = z (tij ). For instance, to model the evolution
                                                                                                   k
of the outcome over time with a polynomial trend, we may use gk (t) = t ,
k = 0, 1, . . . , K . Alternatively, the gk can be orthogonal polynomials (Zhang
et al., 2020).

    For patient     i,    the design matrices for the xed and random eects of
                                                                  T                                           T
the outcome model are            X ‚àói =    xi,1 , . . . , xi,ni        and   Z ‚àói =   z i,1 , . . . , z i,ni        ,
respectively (Pantazis & Touloumi, 2010).                 The model for the clinical outcome
variable is
                                    y ‚àói = X ‚àói Œ≤ + Z ‚àói bi + ei ,                                             (1)

where Œ≤ is a vector of xed regression coecients, bi is a normally distributed
vector of random eects with mean 0, and ei is a vector of residuals for patient
i that are assumed to be independent between patients and normally distributed
                                            ‚àó     2
with mean 0 and variance-covariance matrix Ri = œÉe Ini . Moreover, bi and ei are
assumed to be independent.

      Note that the residual of the LOS model (ei ) is treated as a random eect
in the joint model. This allows accounting for correlations between this residual
and the random eects of the outcome model, which are essentially the cause of
non-ignorable missingness.

      The model assumes that hospital discharge always occurs right after the last
                                              d
available outcome measurement.      Thus, if Li was available in the EHR dataset
            d
and tni = Li we add a small oset (i.e. 0.01 days) to make discharge time slightly
larger than the last outcome measurement time (Pantazis & Touloumi, 2010).
                                                                d
But the discharge time is considered censored at tni + 0.01 if Li is missing in the
               d                         d
dataset or if Li is available but tni ‚â§ Li ‚àí 1.

      By tting the joint model (3) to the data provided by the                            N patients, we
calculate maximum likelihood estimators DÃÇ , Œ≤ÃÇ , œÉÃÇe and œÉÃÇd for D , Œ≤ , œÉe and œÉd ,
                                            
respectively, where D = Var            bJi       (Touloumi et al. 1999; Pantazis & Touloumi

2010).



2.2. Individual Disease Severity and Individual Benets
      Here, we use the estimates of the model parameters to predict the individual
treatment benets of the patients that were used to t the joint model. Following
Diaz (2016; 2019; 2021), we dene the severity of a patient's disease or condition
at a given time point as the probability that the clinical outcome is outside of
the therapeutic target. Here, we assume that the therapeutic target is to achieve
an outcome ‚â§ y , where y is a number prespecied by the clinician. (In the pain
management application, the treatment target was dened as achieving a daily
maximum pain score ‚â§ 6.) Therefore, for a specic patient i, the severity of the
patient's condition at time t after treatment initiation is
                                                                    
                                                        y ‚àí yi (t)
                                  si (t) = Œ¶                             ,                                     (4)

where Œ¶ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and yi (t) is the
                                                                                 T
expected outcome at time t for patient i, that is, yi (t) = xi                       (t) Œ≤ + z T (t)bi .

     The individual benet of the medical treatment for patient i after t days on the
treatment is therefore dened as the reduction in disease severity from baseline
(Diaz, 2016), that is,


                          b (t; Œ≤, bi , œÉe , xi,1 , . . . , xi,p ) = si (0) ‚àí si (t) .                    (5)


     Note that the benet depends on the number of days that the patient has
been under treatment.                We multiply this quantity by 100 for convenience.                   For
instance, a benet of 25% at a specic day after treatment initiation means that
the probability that the patient has achieved the desired therapeutic target has
increased by 25 units on a probability scale from 0 to 100, using the patient's
condition before treatment as a reference point.                             This approach to measuring
the individual benet of a medical treatment allows modeling well-known clinical
phenomena that are relevant to personalized medicine (Diaz 2016; 2019; 2021;
Zhang et al. 2020).



2.3. Empirical Bayesian Prediction of Individual Benets
     In practice, to measure the individual benets of the therapy for patient i, we
need the EB predictor bÃÇi of the patient's random eects bi (Diaz 2016; 2019; 2021).

2.4. Application: Eects of Depression and Age on
     Individual Benets of Pain Management Post Spinal
     Fusion
2.4.1. Data Source and Study Subjects
      The EHR dataset (Cerner Health Facts
                                                  ¬Æ , Kansas City, MO) is deidentied
and has been used in previously published articles (Shaw et al.              2018; Urman
et al.    2018).   An Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption for this study
was granted by Western IRB (Olympia, WA) and the IRB from the University of
Kansas Medical Center agreed with this exemption. We selected adult inpatients
undergoing spinal fusion surgery in a university general hospital between January
1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, using International Classication of Diseases
(ICD) -9 codes 81.00 to 81.08 and corresponding ICD-10 codes. The hospital had
more than 500 beds at that time and is in an urban area in the Northeast census
region of the United States.

      Additional inclusion criteria were 1) at least one pain score on and after the day
of surgery (day 0); 2) a maximum score on day 0 between 7 and 10 inclusive; 3) 1
to 5 days post-surgical hospital stay; and 4) at least 6 months of history captured
in the database prior to the surgery. We identied 330 patients who satised the
inclusion criteria (Table 1).



2.4.2. Pain Assessments
      Numerical patient-reported pain scores ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating
no pain and 10 indicating the most severe pain. The outcome of interest was the
patient's maximum daily score, obtained at day 0 and during 1 to 5 days of post-
surgical hospital stay (Table 2).      Since patients' pain levels were not measured
after discharge, this longitudinal observational study conveys the challenges of a
highly unbalanced dataset caused by non-random missing data. Since pain scores
are usually lower on or after the discharge day, the assumption that missing data
would be random, which is required by standard longitudinal statistical models,
is violated (Ibrahim & Molenberghs, 2009).



2.4.3. Depression Assessments
      Depression comorbidity was dened as having an ICD-9 code (3004, 30112,
3090, 3091, or 311) or an ICD-10 code (F320, F321, F322, F323, F328, F3281,
F3289, F329, F330, F331, F332, F333, F338, F339, F341, or F4321) during
the hospital stay or within 6 months before admission,                or having received
antidepressants during the stay (Table 1).

2.4.4. Hospital Length of Stay
    The     patients'     hospital       LOS      after     surgery      may      be    aected   by   their
characteristics and responses to postoperative pain management. Pain levels are
usually not measured after discharge and even when patients are in the hospital
their pain measurements may be terminated for various reasons. Thus, hospital
LOS was included in the analyses and was dened as the number of days elapsed
from surgery to hospital discharge.

    In most patients (326/330), the last pain score was observed on the day of the
discharge. In the remaining patients, it was determined before the day of discharge
and the outcome was therefore considered censored on the day of the last pain
score measurement. An oset of 0.01 was added to both LOS and censoring times

2.4.5. Transformation of Pain Scores
      We transformed the maximum daily pain scores before data analyses using a
transformation that we call discrete logit transformation, given by
                                                                                 
                                                            Pain Scoreij + 1
                 yij = T (Pain Scoreij ) = log                                        ,             (7)
                                                          m + 1 ‚àí Pain Scoreij
where m is the maximum value of the pain scale (m = 10 in this application),
and Pain Scoreij is the maximum daily pain score for patient i at day tij . This
transformation allows accounting for possible oor eects  we expected the pain
scores of many patients to decrease over time and stabilize at a minimum value
due to the pain management therapy.                  Moreover, since the distribution of the
pain scores was highly skewed with higher frequencies for severe pain scores, this
transformation helped improve the goodness-of-t of the outcome model. After the
transformation, the distribution of the EB predictor of the LOS model residuals
and those of the random intercept and random eect of time for the pain score
model were relatively normal, suggesting a good model t.

      The transformation in equation (7) can be viewed as an adaptation of the
logistic transformation to a bounded continuous latent variable measured with
nite precision equal to 1. In fact, here, we imagine a patient's pain level as a
continuous latent variable, which has been measured with integer numbers from 0
to 10. The ability of the logistic transformation to produce approximate normal
distributions was originally investigated by Johnson (1949) for unbounded and
bounded outcomes. The bounded case was further investigated by Lesare, who
also applied the transformation to discrete measures of continuous latent variables.

Measuring Individual Benets with Longitudinal Hospital Data                                    285



    In the context of our study, using transformation (7) is essentially equivalent
to assuming that, conditional on the random eects, the distribution of the
pain scores can be approximated by a scaled distribution in the family of logit-
normal distributions, which is a very exible family that includes distributions of
many dierent shapes including right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric and bathtub
shapes (Lesare et al., 2007).

    To calculate individual benets, we assumed that the clinician wants to achieve
pain scores ‚â§ 6.      Since daily maximum pain scores were transformed using the
discrete logit transformation, the therapeutic target was therefore to reach a
transformed pain score ‚â§ T (6) = 0.3365.               This was the value of y in equation
(4).



2.4.6. Joint model for Pain Scores and Hospital Discharge Day
    We built a joint multivariate random-eects model, which is a generalized linear
mixed-eects model that accounts for non-ignorable missingness (Touloumi et al.
1999; Pantazis & Touloumi 2010). The model combined a model of daily maximum
pain scores with a model of LOS to account for the missing pain measurements
caused by hospital discharge (Table 3). The simultaneous modeling of LOS and
pain took into consideration the correlations between them. It reduced the bias
associated with the unbalanced data, providing more accurate estimation of the
eects of the covariates on pain scores (Touloumi et al., 1999).

    To build the joint model, we followed a backward selection procedure that
locked the time variable and was based on both p-values from Wald tests and the
examination of covariate eect sizes at each step (Woodward 2014; Hedeker &
Gibbons 2006). The initial pain and LOS models included geriatric age (1 if age
> 65 years, 0 otherwise), depression (1 if the patient had depression comorbidity, 0
otherwise), and potential confounders available in the database including gender,
race, and some comorbidities (rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, liver disease, renal
failure, peripheral vascular disease, and other neurological disorders). A variable
was kept in both the pain and LOS models if it was signicant in only one model
or in both at a 0.05 signicance level.

    The variables included in the nal pain model were geriatric age, depression,
time as the number of days after surgery, and the interaction between depression
and time. The transformed pain scores followed a linear time trend. The intercept
and the time slope were considered random, meaning they were dierent for each
patient (Diaz 2016; 2019).

    Results of the LOS model are also provided in Table 3. It was assumed that the
random residual of the LOS model was correlated with both the random intercept
and random time slope of the pain model.                  Gender, race, and the examined
comorbidities did not exhibit any signicant eects on pain scores or LOS and
were therefore not included in the nal model.

    In matrix notation, if xi1 and xi2 denote the dichotomous variables geriatric
age and depression, respectively, then                X ‚àói = [1 Xi1 Xi2 ti Xi3 ], where Xi1 =
               T                            T                                 T

                                   T
Xi3 = (xi2 ti1 , . . . , xi2 tini ) is the interaction between depression and time, and 1 is
                                                                            d
an ni √ó1 vector of ones. In the LOS model, the design vector was xi = (1, xi1 , xi2 ).

      In summary, the pain model included a random intercept and a random slope
for time and had the form


  Transformed Scoresij = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1 √ó (Geriatric Age)i + Œ≤2 √ó Depressioni

              + Œ≤3 √ó Timeij + Œ≤4 √ó Depressioni √ó Timeij + b0i + b1i √ó Timeij + eij ,

where eij indicates the residuals for the pain score model for patient i at occasion
j which has mean 0 and residual variance œÉe2 (Table 3). The parameters Œ≤k , k =
1, . . . , 4, are population-average eects (the xed eects), whereas b0i and b1i are
parameters specic to patient i that represent deviations from the corresponding
population averages (the random eects). And the model of LOS for patient i had
the form


          log (LOSi ) = Œ≤0d + Œ≤1d √ó (Geriatric Age)i + Œ≤2d √ó Depressioni + edi ,

          d
where ei is a random residual following a normal distribution with mean 0.

    We tted the joint model using the jmre1 command of Stata and calculated
bJEB,i with the command predict (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) (Table
3) (Pantazis & Touloumi, 2010). To test the signicance of a correlation between
two random eects, we computed a likelihood ratio test that compared the nal
model with a model for which the corresponding covariance was set to 0.




2.4.7. Individual Benets of Pain Management
      The severity of the patient's disease was dened as the probability of being
outside of the pain treatment target, which in turn was dened as a daily maximum
pain score      ‚â§ 6 (Diaz 2016; 2019).       The patient's individual treatment benet
was therefore the decrease in disease severity from baseline (√ó100). To examine
how much benet patients received from postoperative pain management during
the 5 days after spinal fusion, we predicted the patients' individual benets.
The estimated random eects of a patient were used to predict his/her benets,
combining the patient's available data with parameter estimates in Table 3, using
formula (6).

      For each patient, individual benets were predicted from day 0.2 to day 5 by
0.2 -day increments, by interpolation with formula (6). In fact, although the time
variable in the EHR data was available only in the form of integer days 0, 1, . . . , 5,
formula (6) allowed predicting benets for any non-integer time point from 0 to 5
days (Diaz 2016; 2019). Median, 25
                                           th and 75th percentiles of individual benets
were calculated. For each of the 4 groups determined by age and depression status,
these statistics were plotted in Figure 1. They are also presented in Table 4 for
days 1 through 5.

geriatric age and depression status.                              In contrast to the approach that we used
to calculate Table 4 and Figure 1, this approach does not require EB prediction,
but it is more computationally demanding and does not allow examining individual
benets for specic patients in the EHR data (Zhang et al., 2020).                                         The Monte
Carlo approach, however, is useful as a reference standard for investigating whether
EB individual benet predictors reect estimated overall population trends reliably
(Zhang et al., 2020). Ideally, sample quartiles of EB predicted benets should be
close to Monte Carlo estimates of population quartiles. The Monte Carlo approach
to the analysis of individual benets has been previously used to validate the EB
approach in the context of longitudinal binary outcomes (Zhang et al., 2020).

      transformation, the treatment target corresponded to a transformed pain score ‚â§0.3365.



    In the context of the joint model for pain scores and LOS, the Monte Carlo
estimates of population quartiles are in Table 6 and were produced with the
following algorithm:


   1. Draw 1,000 random eects for each subpopulation of patients from the
       estimated distribution of the random eects bi of the pain score model, using
       the parameter estimates in Table 3.                      Each of these random eects vectors
       represents a simulated            new patient (Diaz 2016; 2019; Zhang et al. 2020).
   2. Generate the random intercept and random coecient of time of the pain
       score model for the 1,000 simulated patients in each subpopulation by adding
       up the random eects to their corresponding estimated xed eects given in
       Table 3.


   3. Calculate benets for each of the 1,000 patients on days 1 through 5 post-
       surgery by using the formula b(t; Œ≤ÃÇ, bi , œÉÃÇe ,                xi,1 , . . . , xi,p ).

   4. For each of the four subpopulations, calculate the median and the 25
                                                                                                              th and
       75
         th percentiles of the benets of the 1,000 patients for days 1 through 5
       post-surgery.


    The above Monte Carlo approach is a numerical method for calculating
population percentiles of the distribution of individual benets that utilizes the
model parameter estimates in Table 3 (Zhang et al., 2020). By simulating many
patients, we take advantage of the law of large numbers to numerically approximate
the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of individual benets. Thus,

with this approach, we solve a deterministic numerical problem using random
number generation.

      Note that the Monte Carlo approach is not an empirical Bayesian approach. In
fact, the former is not mediated by the calculation of the EB predictors given by
Formula (6). That is, we do not need to estimate the benets of specic individuals
to implement the Monte Carlo approach. In this sense, the Monte Carlo approach
to the estimation of population percentiles is an alternative method that is useful
only to analyze population trends and does not allow for examining the benets
of specic patients. In contrast, in the EB approach described in Section 2.4.7.,
we predict the individual benets of each of the patients in the database and
then calculate the   sample percentiles of these benets as if these were a random
sample of true benets. Showing that the Monte Carlo and EB approaches yield
similar estimates of population percentiles of individual benets can be regarded
as evidence that the EB approach produces reliable estimates (Zhang et al., 2020).




3. Results
3.1. Patient Characteristics
      Patients' characteristics, pain and antidepressant medications are in Table 1.
Almost half (46%) the patients had comorbid depression.             Depression was more
frequent in females (54%, 94/173) than in males (36%, 56/157) and in non-geriatric
patients (49%, 132/271) than in geriatric patients (31%, 18/59).             Baseline pain
scores and hospital LOS are in Table 1.



3.2. Correlations Between LOS Model Residuals and Pain
     Model Random Eects
      Table 3 shows the correlations between the random eects of the pain model
and the residuals of the LOS model. The correlations were signicantly dierent
from 0. Specically, the correlation between the LOS residuals and the random
intercept of the pain model was 0.4985 (p < 0.001), whereas the correlation between
the LOS residuals and the random eect of time was 0.6631 (p < 0.001). These
signicant correlations conrm the expected dependency of hospital discharge on
pain levels and, therefore, suggest that the pain scores that were not recorded
after discharge are nonignorable missing data. Our simultaneous modeling of pain
scores and hospital LOS is therefore justied.



3.3. Joint Model and the Impact of Depression and Age on
     Pain Scores and LOS
      We found signicant correlations between 1) high baseline pain scores and
longer postoperative LOS (r        = 0.4985, p < 0.001; Table 3), 2) slower pain
reduction and longer LOS (r        = 0.6631, p < 0.001), and 3) high baseline pain

scores and slower pain reduction post-surgery (r        = 0.8471, p < 0.001).       These
correlations indicated that 1) patients who had higher baseline pain scores tended
to stay longer after surgery; 2) patients whose pain decreased more slowly after
surgery tended to stay longer; and 3) patients with higher pain scores at baseline
tended to have slower pain reduction after surgery.

   The pain model suggested that, on average:             1) a preoperative record of
depression was signicantly associated with higher baseline pain scores (p = 0.001;
Table 3); 2) geriatric age was signicantly associated with lower baseline pain
scores (p   = 0.047); and 3) a signicant interaction existed between depression
and time (parameter estimate = 0.1327, p = 0.045), meaning that patients with
depression had signicantly slower pain reduction after surgery.

   The LOS model suggested that, on average: 1) geriatric age was signicantly
associated with longer LOS (p = 0.001; Table 3); and 2) depression tended to
be associated with a slightly longer LOS, although it did not reach signicance
(p = 0.096).



3.4. Impact of Depression and Age on Individual Benets of
     Postoperative Pain Management
   Although treatment benets tended to increase over time for all four patient
groups, the amount and rate of change of achieved benets varied across groups
(Table 4). For instance, at day 1, in non-geriatric patients without depression the
median decrease in disease severity was 18.6% probability units compared to 5.6%
in non-geriatric patients with depression.

   By day 5, the median achieved benets were comparable for patients with
or without depression.   However, the rst quartiles for patients with depression
tended to be smaller than those for non-depressed patients in the comparable age
group at specic times, indicating that there were more patients with depression
receiving small benets than patients without depression after controlling for age
and time.

   For patients with depression, non-geriatric age was associated with slower
individual benet development. For instance, in geriatric patients with depression,
the median decrease in disease severity was 12.1% probability units at day 1
compared to 5.6% for non-geriatric patients with depression. On day 5, the rst
quartile for geriatric patients with depression (75.1%) was higher than that for
non-geriatric patients with depression (57.2%).        Figure 1A illustrates that, for
average patients with depression, non-geriatric age was associated with smaller
benets, compared to geriatric age. In general, average patients with depression
had much smaller benets after controlling for age.

   In patients receiving the least benet from pain management the combination
of depression and non-geriatric age was associated with the slowest responses,
whereas non-geriatric age without depression was associated with the fastest
responses (Figure 1B). Interestingly,      for the patients achieving the greatest
benets (Figure 1C), individual benets were more clearly aected by depression
comorbidity than by age.

3.5. Individual Benets One Day after Surgery as Predictors
     of LOS
      To examine whether levels of individual benets from post-surgery pain
management achieved after 1 day are predictive of hospital LOS, we compared
the LOS of patients from among the 1
                                                     st , 2nd , 3rd , and 4th quartiles for individual
benets (Table 5). Patients with higher immediate benets tended to have shorter
LOS.



3.6. Comparison of Quartiles of Empirical Bayesian
     Individual Estimates with Monte Carlo Quartile
     Estimates
      The patterns of the evolution of individual antipsychotic benets over time
shown by the Monte Carlo quartile estimates (Table 6) were very similar to those
observed when the sample quartiles of EB benet predictors were used (Table 4).
For instance, in patients with depression, those with non-geriatric age obtained
the benets of pain therapy more slowly than older patients.                              Moreover, other
things being equal, patients with depression tended to obtain smaller benets
than patients without depression. The rst and third quartiles presented in Table
6 also allow conclusions like those obtained from Table 4 described in Section 3.4.
The similarities between Tables 4 and 6 suggest the adequacy of EB predictors of
individual benets for detecting overall clinical population trends (Zhang et al.,
2020).     EB predictors, however, have the additional advantage that they allow
examining the benets achieved by single patients, which makes them useful for
potential applications in clinical practice (Diaz 2016; 2019; 2021).

      Interestingly, the interquartile ranges of the EB predictions of individual
benets tended to be shorter than those calculated through the Monte Carlo
approach (Tables 4 and 6). This should not be surprising, however, because EB
predictors tend to reect the shrinkage property of best linear unbiased predictors
(BLUPs) of random eects (Frees, 2004).



3.7. Limitations of the Application
      Our data analysis included patients with severe pain (‚â•7) at baseline and
at least one pain score and who stayed at least 1 day in the hospital.                                  These

criteria may have excluded less severe cases so our results cannot be extrapolated
to them. Moreover, the pain scores used in this study were self-reported. Patient-
reported measures such as pain scores and levels of satisfaction are important
measures for evaluating treatment eects (Lotzke et al., 2016).                            They could be
biased, however, since each patient may have dierent levels of sensitivity and
expectation. However, predictors of individual benets, which are on a probability
scale, compare baseline pain severity with post-treatment severity within a patient,
canceling out potential individual biases in the perception of pain.

    We did not nd evidence that gender or race had signicant eects on pain
scores or LOS. We cannot rule out, however, that other variables that were
not available in the EHR database such as surgeon may have had potentially
confounding eects.          Moreover, 99% of the patients who had health insurance
information had some form of insurance covering.                         Thus, the lack of insurance
could not be a confounding variable in these analyses.

    Unfortunately, it was not possible to include the type of pain treatment as a
covariate in the joint model because all patients were on opioids and nearly all (226
out of 330) received an additional pain medication (Table 1).                         Thus, it was not
possible to investigate whether pain treatment choice interacted with depression
or antidepressant use and impacted pain or LOS.




4. Discussion
    Electronic health records (EHR) provide valuable resources for longitudinal
studies and understanding risk factors associated with poor clinical outcomes.
However, they may not provide complete follow-up, and the missing data are
not at random since hospital discharge may depend in part on expected but
unrecorded clinical outcomes after discharge (Ibrahim & Molenberghs, 2009). This
non-ignorable missingness requires appropriate statistical techniques (Pantazis



                        Revista Colombiana de Estad√≠stica - Applied Statistics 45 (2022) 275-300

294                          Xuan Zhang, Nikos Pantazis, Jose de Leon & Francisco J. Diaz

& Touloumi, 2010).       Ignoring the unbalanced nature of longitudinal EHR data
may lead to serious bias (Albers et al., 2018).

      In this paper, we extended the methods for individual treatment benet
prediction based on mixed-eects models proposed by Diaz (2016; 2019; 2021) to
allow for non-ignorable missingness in the longitudinal data. Modeling informative
drop-out in the analysis of clinical trial data with some patients dropping out of the
study after randomization is common in statistical practice (Pantazis & Touloumi,
2010); however, our proposal of extending this concept to real-world hospital data
for which the follow-up data are incomplete due to hospital discharge is novel.
This is the rst paper to analyze individual treatment benets as dened by Diaz
(2016) using EHR data. Since EHR data are becoming more and more important
in clinical evidence generation, this work oers a useful way of analyzing treatment
eects from a personalized medicine perspective.

      Generalized   linear    mixed-eects   modeling   of   longitudinal   outcomes    is   a
statistical approach useful for predicting individuated treatment benets (Diaz
2016; 2019; 2021; Zhang et al.           2020; Wang & Diaz 2020), which takes into
consideration the heterogeneity of patients' characteristics including unknown
traits.   While traditional statistical analyses focus on average treatment eects,
mixed-eects modeling can analyze the variation of treatment eects in individual
patients. Moreover, in the joint mixed modeling approach followed in this work,
the correlations between longitudinal outcomes and hospital LOS that cause non-
ignorable missingness are taken into consideration, leading to more reliable and
accurate estimation of the parameters of the outcome model (Touloumi et al.,
1999).    More accurate parameter estimates in turn lead to better predictions of
individual treatment benets.

      In our application, longitudinal pain score data from patients undergoing
spinal fusion surgery were modeled simultaneously with post-surgical LOS, and
then individual benets of pain management were measured in accordance with
the denition of treatment benets proposed by Diaz (2016; 2019; 2021).                 Our
application showed that it is important to further understand the impact of
patients' characteristics such as preoperative depression and age upon individual
benets of pain management after spinal fusion surgery. We compared individual
benets of pain management among four groups of patients determined by
depression diagnosis and age. An examination of median benets was not enough,
and other subgroups of individuals emerged (Figure 1).             In average patients,
age played an important role in those with depression, who were prone to receive
less benet (Figure 1A). In contrast, among patients tending to receive the least
benet (Figure 1B), younger patients without depression achieved some benet
quicker than geriatric patients with depression, whereas younger patients with
depression benetted least from pain management.              Moreover, among patients
achieving the highest benets (Figure 1C), the eect of age on treatment benets
was negligible compared to the eect of depression. Our nding that the eect of
age is unimportant in patients receiving high benets is consistent with a previous
study that found that, although elderly patients reported lower pain scores post-
total knee replacement, their functional impairment caused by pain did not dier
from younger patients (Weinmann et al., 2017).

Measuring Individual Benets with Longitudinal Hospital Data                            295



   Interestingly, patients who received less benet from one day of post-surgery
pain management tended to stay longer at the hospital (Table 5), suggesting that
early benet measurements may serve as predictors of hospital LOS after surgery.

   To rule out the possibility that antidepressant medication explains the observed
slower response to pain management in patients with depression, we tted an
additional joint mixed model using only patients with depression, similar to the
model in Table 3 except that the depression variable was replaced by antidepressant
use (data not shown).       Antidepressants were not signicantly associated with
baseline pain scores or pain management response.           Thus, the slow response to
pain management in patients with depression may be due to the comorbidity itself
instead of antidepressant medication.
