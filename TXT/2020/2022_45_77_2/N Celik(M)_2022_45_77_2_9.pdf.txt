Abstract
The pairwise comparisons or post-hoc methods are used for determining the source of the dierence of group means in one-way ANOVA. These methods are mostly depend on normality assumption. However, nonnormal distributions are more prevalent than normal distribution. Therefore, robust estimation methods become very important tools in statistical analysis. In this paper, we assume that the distribution of the error terms is Azzalini's skew t and obtain the robust estimators in order to make post-hoc tests in one-way ANOVA. We use maximum likelihood (ML) methodology and compare this methodology with some of robust estimators like M estimator, Wave estimator, trimmed mean and modied maximum likelihood (MML) methodology with Monte Carlo simulation study. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology is more preferable. We also compare power values of the test statistics and conclude that the test statistics based on the ML estimators are more powerful than the test statistics based on other methods.

Resumen
Las comparaciones por pares o métodos post-hoc se utilizan para determinar la fuente de la diferencia de medias de grupo en ANOVA unidireccional. Estos métodos dependen principalmente de la suposición de normalidad. Sin embargo, no normales distribuciones son más frecuentes que la distribución normal. Por lo tanto, los métodos robustos de estimación se convierten en herramientas muy importantes en el análisis estadístico. En este artículo, asumimos que la distribución de los términos de error es la de Azzalini sesgar t y obtener los estimadores robustos para realizar pruebas post-hoc en ANOVA de una vía. Utilizamos la metodología de máxima verosimilitud (ML) y comparamos esta metodología con algunos de los estimadores robustos como el estimador M, estimador de onda, media recortada y máxima verosimilitud modicada (MML) metodología con estudio de simulación Monte Carlo. Los resultados de la simulación muestran que la metodología propuesta es más preferible. También comparamos potencia valores de las estadísticas de prueba y concluimos que las estadísticas de prueba basadas en los estimadores ML son más poderosos que las estadísticas de prueba basadas en otros métodos.

1. Introduction

    The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used for comparing the means of three or
more groups. Comparing group means is processed with the help of F statistics
obtained by partition of total variance. ANOVA concludes that whether there is
a dierence between group means, however, the source of the dierence cannot
be determined. Therefore, multiple comparisons or post-hoc methods are used
for understanding the source of the dierence of group means. There are many
methods in statistics literature such as Least Signicant Dierence (LSD) method,
Tukey's method and linear contrast method.
    Most of post-hoc tests depend on normality assumption. If the assumption
of normality is not satised, the least square (LS) estimators lose their eciency
and the test statistics based on them have lower power values. Therefore, it
is very important to develop robust estimators of the parameter of interest.
There are many studies about robust multiple comparison test, for example,
(Tukey & McLaughlin, 1963) proposed T-methodology based on studentized range
distribution with equal sample sizes. Tukey & McLaughlin (1963) and Dunnett
(1982) developed this methodology with unequal sample sizes. Ringland (1983) use
M estimators, Dunnett (1982) compared many robust estimators like Huber's wave
(W24), bisqure (BS82), Hampel (H22), trimmed mean with winsorized standard
deviation using 10% trimming (TM10), modied maximum likelihood (MML)
estimator with 10% censoring (MML10) and sample mean in a modied T-method
for pairwise multiple comparisons. Balci & Akkaya (2015) used MML estimators
with using short tailed symmetric distributions and resulted that to avoid W24
and TM10 methodology under short tailed symmetric distributions. In this study
we extend the comparisons with using Azzalini's skew t (St) distribution (Azzalini
& Capitanio, 2003).
    The reason for assuming the St distribution as an error distribution is that it
is exible for modelling the data sets having both skewness and heavy tails Celik
(2012), since it reduces to the well known normal, skew normal and Student's t
distribution. Additionally, St distribution has a very wide application areas, such

as nance, engineering, quality control and medicine, see for example Nakajima
(2017); Ahmad Radi et al. (2017); Tagle et al. (2019) and Beranger et al. (2021).
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, a brief
description of robust post-hoc multiple comparison method is given. In section 3,
skew t distribution and its some statistical properties are summarized. In section 4,
alternative robust methods and ML methodology is described. In simulation study
section, these estimators are compared by using relative eciency (RE) criterion
for some representative values of the distribution parameters. Also, power values
of these test statistics are compared. A real data set is analyzed to interpretation
of the proposed method. Conclusion is given at the end of this paper.



2. Robust Post-Hoc Multiple Comparisons

   Consider the one-way ANOVA model

               yij = µ + αi + +ϵij ,     i = 1, 2, . . . , a; j = 1, 2, . . . , n      (1)


where yij is the response corresponding to the jth observation in the ith treatment,
µ is the overall mean, αi is the eect of ith treatment and ϵij are the independently
and identically distributed (iid) error terms. In one-way ANOVA, our aim is to test
the treatment eects. After rejecting the null hypothesis (µ1 = µ2 = · · · = µa ),
the post-hoc multiple comparisons methods are used to determine the dierence
between pairwise treatments. Therefore, the following null hypothesis


                       H0 = µi = µj , i, j = 1, 2, . . . , a; i ̸= j                   (2)

is tested. As mentioned in the previous section, many methods have been used for
testing the hypothesis when the normality assumption is not satised. [4] proposed
the modied T-method with robust estimators of location and scale parameters.
The test statistic max |t̃ij | is dened as


                                    µ̃i − µ̃i − (µi − µj )
                              t̃ij = q                                                 (3)
                                        S̃i2 /ni + S̃j2 /nj

where µ̃i is the robust location estimator of the ith treatment, S̃i2 is the robust
scale estimator of the corresponding treatment and ni is the sample size. If
max |t̃ij | > A∗ij,α,a the null hypothesis given in equation (2) is rejected at the
level of signicance α. A∗ij,α,a represents a constant which is to be chosen so that
the desired joint condence coecient 1−α is achieved as closely as possible (Balci
& Akkaya, 2015). In this study the value of A∗ij,α,a is simulated in order to achieve
true α value.

3. Skew t Distribution

   The probability density function (pdf) of the St distribution has the following
form

                                                              r            !
                                                                   v+1
                       fSt (x; λ) = 2tν (x)Tv+1 λx                                       (4)
                                                                  v + x2

where tν (.) is pdf of Student's t distribution with degrees of freedom ν , Tv+1 (.) is
cumulative distribution function (cdf) of Student's t distribution with degrees of
freedom v + 1. The location-scale form of 4 can be written as follows
                                            (          s             )
                              2 x − µ        x − µ      v+1
            fSt (x; µ, σ, λ) = tν       Tv+1 λ                                           (5)

                                                                σ )
                                                                   2


where µ is the location parameter, σ is the scale parameter, ν is the degrees
of freedom and λ is the skewness parameter. We will use the notation X ∼
Stν (µ, σ, λ) if the random variable X has St distribution with the parameters µ,
σ , ν and λ. If X ∼ Stν (µ, σ, λ), then the mean and the variance of X are given by
                                                         

                                                          2

and
                                                                   !2
                             ν    ν λ2                Γ( ν−1
                                                           2 )
                   V (X) =      −                                       , ν > 2,         (7)
                           ν − 2 π 1 + λ2              Γ( ν2 )

respectively.
    It should be also noted that Stν (0, 1, λ) reduces to the well-known Student's
t distribution when λ = 0 and to the standard normal distribution when v → ∞
and λ = 0. For ν → ∞ and λ > 0, St distribution reduces to skew normal
distribution. This property gains us exibility for modelling various types of data
with symmetric, skewed and heavy tailed. Therefore, St distribution is used in
many areas such as nance, medicine, engineering and geography.


4. Alternative Robust Estimators

    In this paper, we use alternative robust estimators in order to compare the
performances of test statistics given in equation (3). We use sample mean and
variance, W24 estimator, trimmed mean with winsorized standard deviation, M
estimators and ML estimators (proposed by Ringland, 1983).
      The location and scale estimators of Wave method are given as

Taking the derivatives of the ln L with respect to the parameters of interest and

                 i
the likelihood equations, it is not possible to nd the closed form expressions
for the ML estimators. Therefore, we resort to iterative methods to solve them
numerically. In order to obtain the ML estimates of the unknown parameters in
model (1), we use the EM algorithm which is an iterative computational method.
The solutions of the likelihood functions and the steps for the iteration method
are given in Celik (2012).



5. Simulation Study

    In this section, we compare sample mean, W24, TM10, M and ML estimators
of location in terms of eciencies for some representative values of skewness
parameter λ and the degrees of freedom ν . To compare the eciencies of the
related estimators under St distribution, we simulated the means and the variances
of the maximum dierence of µ̃i − µ̃i , i, j = 1, 2, . . . , a; i ̸= j with [|100, 000/n|]
times via MATLAB programming. [|.|] denotes rounding a decimal to the nearest
integer number. It should be also noted that the RE values are calculated based
on LS estimators.
    As can be seen from Table 1 that the eciencies of the ML estimators increases
when the sample size (n) and the skewness parameter (λ) increase. On the other
hand the eciencies decreases when the degrees of freedom of St distribution
increases. It can be also seen that; the eciencies of ML estimators are higher
than other methods as expected. The eciencies of W24 and TM10 estimators are
lower than eciencies of the traditional LS methodology under skew t distribution.
   We now compare the power of the test statistics for various values of the
skewness parameter and the degrees of freedom. Simulation results showing the
power comparisons of the proposed tests with the traditional tests are given in
Table 2. Table 2 indicates that, the power values of the test statistics obtained by
ML methodology has the highest values among other alternatives for all values of
λ and ν . On the other hand, the power values of the test statistics based on M
methodologies are higher than other robust alternatives under the St distributions.

6. Numerical Example

    In this section, Acylated Steryl Glucosides (ASG) values of patients are
examined after giving three types of blood serum in order to obtain whether there
is a dierence between serum types with respect to ASG values of patients. Table
3 shows the data.
    To clarify the distribution of the error terms, we t some selected statistical
distributions to the data then calculate ln L and the Akaike information criterion
(AIC) values for these distribution. The St distribution provides better tting to
the data then the other distributions with the maximum ln L and the minimum
AIC values. Estimates of the degrees of freedom ν and the skewness parameter
λ are obtained to be 7.02 and 0.74 respectively. After processing robust ANOVA
assuming that the distribution of error terms as St distribution, we reject the
hypothesis saying that there is no dierence between blood serum types with
respect to ASG values. On the other hand, when the traditional ANOVA process
is used, the hypothesis is not rejected, see detailed calculations and explanations
at Celik (2012).
    To test the null hypothesis H0 = µ2 = µ3 against H0 = µ2 ̸= µ3 , we obtain
the values of the test statistic based on LS, ML, M, W24 and TM10 estimators as
follows:

   As can be seen from Table 5, the p-value obtained by ML methods is lower than
0.05, the p-value obtained by M method is approximately 0.05 and on the other
hand, the others are greater than 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis
H0 = µ2 = µ3 with ML methodology, however we do not reject with other
methodologies. The p-value obtained by using ML estimators is smallest which
implies that ML estimators are the most ecient.

7. Conclusion

    In this study, robust post-hoc (modied-T) methodology is applied by using
LS, ML, W24, TM10 and M estimators under St distribution. Eciencies and
power values of these estimators are compared using Monte Carlo simulation study.
The eciencies based on ML methodology has the greatest values among other
alternatives. Similarly, the power values obtained by using ML methodology are
the highest than other robust alternatives.
