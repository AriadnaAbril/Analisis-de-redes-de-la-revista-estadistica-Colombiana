Abstract
Postoperative infection is common in dental surgery, for example, in the removal of the third molar. To control these and other postoperative complications, various studies have reported the use of some drug protocols, namely the prophylact and the preemptive ones, using drugs such as dexamethasone and betamethasone. In this work, we used the generalized linear model via logistic regression to verify whether, in addition to the medicaments mentioned, some covariates that are frequently used in dental surgeries inuence the occurrence, or not, of postoperative infection in surgeries for removal of the third molar. One of the main reasons that led us to employ such a model is because the response variable (having or not having infection) presents values of the binary type, in addition to being one of the most applied models in the area of health, among them, the dentistry area. The application of descriptive methods and analysis of association via statistical tests were also used to choose other factors that inuence the response variable infection in addition to medications. The AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) selection criterion, analysis of the dierence in the deviations, and the analysis of residual using the half-normal plot for selection and the assumption of the proposed model were employed. The data set under analysis consists of 113 patients submitted to dental surgery in a specialized clinic in the city of Piracicaba, SP-Brazil 2003 and 2018. Through the proposed model, some important information the covariates in relation to the patients submitted to dental surgery. One of the key information is that characteristics as Age and Dental extractions are associated with the inammatory processes after surgery. This relationship indicates that the older the patient, the chance of having an infection after surgery increases. The analysis is similar to the Number of extractions.

Resumen
La infección postoperatoria es común en cirugía dental, por ejemplo, en la extracción del tercer molar. Para el control de estas y otras complicaciones postoperatorias, diversos estudios han reportado el uso de algunos protocolos farmacológicos, a saber, el proláctico y el preventivo, utilizando fármacos como la dexametasona y la betametasona. En este trabajo utilizamos el modelo lineal generalizado mediante regresión logística para vericar si, además de los medicamentos mencionados, algunas covariables que se utilizan con frecuencia en las cirugías dentales inuyen en la aparición o no de infección posoperatoria en las cirugías de extracción del tercer tercio. molar. Una de las principales razones que nos llevó a emplear dicho modelo es porque la variable respuesta (tener o no tener infección) presenta valores de tipo binario, además de ser uno de los modelos más aplicados en el área de la salud, entre ellos, el área de odontología. También se utilizó la aplicación de métodos descriptivos y análisis de asociación a través de pruebas estadísticas para elegir otros factores que inuyen en la variable respuesta infección además de los medicamentos. Se empleó el criterio de selección AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), el análisis de la diferencia en las desviaciones y el análisis de residuos utilizando la seminormal para la selección y la asunción del modelo propuesto. El conjunto de datos bajo análisis consta de 113 pacientes sometidos a cirugía dental en una clínica especializada en la ciudad de Piracicaba, SP-Brasil entre 2003 y 2018. A través del modelo propuesto, algunas informaciones importantes las covariables en relación a los pacientes sometidos a cirugía dental. Uno de los datos clave es que características como la edad y las extracciones dentales están asociadas a los procesos inamatorios posteriores a la cirugía. Esta relación indica que a mayor edad del paciente, aumenta la probabilidad de tener una infección después de la cirugía. El análisis es similar al Número de extracciones.

1. Introduction
    Lower third molar extraction is the most commonly procedure performed by
surgeons maxillofacial all around the world (Cankaya et al., 2011). Like any type
of surgery, it has risks, accidents, and complications that can aect the patients
(Azenha et al., 2014; Chiapasco et al., 1993). According to Alsaedi (2021), tooth
extraction was a signicant factor when associated with tooth decay, which is a
type of tooth infection. Santosh (2015) claims that one of the relevant factors for
the occurrence of complications associated with tooth removal is the patient's age.
    Among the most frequent postoperative complications in dentistry studies most
common related to third molar removal, the alveolar osteitis and the surgical eld
infection stand out (Bui et al., 2003) which in most situations make this type
of procedure an uncomfortable experience for patients who are submitted to it.
Therefore, ecient control of inammation performs an important role once the
prophylactic and preemptive eects of various drugs have been investigated and
the results have largely supported the use of corticosteroids (Mehra et al., 2013;
Sotto-Maior et al., 2011).
    The literature presents a linear association between the duration of the
procedure and the incidence of infection Guglielmo et al. (1983); Capuzzi et al.
(1994); Lacasa et al. (2007). From this perspective, Lacasa et al. (2007) arrms
that the diculty is characterized by the need for osteotomy during the surgical
procedure and can increase the incidence of infections from 3.5% to 12.7%.
However, the incidence of localized infections of the oral cavity decreased with
the use of antibiotic prophylaxis when compared to placebo in patients submited
to tooth extraction (Moreno-Drada & García-Perdomo, 2016; Susarla et al., 2011).
    The indiscriminate use of antibiotics increases the risk of toxicity related to
allergic reactions, secondary infections and bacterial resistance (Poeschl et al.,
2004; Zeitler, 1995). The prevalence of adverse events after antibiotic therapy
varies from 6 to 7% (Atao§lu et al., 2008), where the main events are nausea
and diarrhea (Limeres et al., 2009). Recommendations for the use of antibiotic
prophylaxis in surgery is to apply the antimicrobial in the correct moment and as
soon as possible. Furthermore, they must be ecient and present low toxicity.
Thus, the use of prophylaxis should be considered and indicated for patients
submitted to more invasive surgeries in which osteotomies are necessary for
one or more operative sites, or in patients with pre-existing diseases, or even
immunocompromised (Laskin, 2003; Nishimura et al., 2008).
    In an attempt to control postoperative complications after third molar
extraction, numerous studies have reported the eectiveness of some drugs such
as dexamethasone and betamethasone (Chaudhary et al., 2015; Lima et al., 2018;
Vicentini et al., 2018). Both have lower mineralocorticoid activity, a half-life of
36-72 hours, and 25 times greater eectveness than hydrocortisone in reducing
inammatory mediators that have less eect on leukocyte chemotaxis. Also, in
programmed elective surgeries, there is a unique opportunity to prepare patients
for the surgical procedure, eectively preventing the triad of pain, edema, and
infection, symptoms of classic occurrences of invasive surgical procedures. This

preventive care provide these patients a more comfortable postoperative period,
free from complications secondary to surgery, and for this, the use of medications
is inevitable.
    In many situations in the dental eld, statistical tools are used to ease the
interpretation of data and assist in decision-making. Among the statistical
methodologies used in this area, logistic regression stands out because in many
cases the researcher is interested in analyzing data whose response variable is of
the binary type. Many works contributed to the modeling of dental data. For
example, Alsaedi (2021) used logistic regression to determine some dependent
variables that were eective on dental caries.
    Thus, the main objective of this manuscript is to verify the eectiveness
of drug protocols (prophylactic and preemptive), to verify some characteristics
collected from patients undergoing surgery, in addition to factors related to surgical
procedures. Through the analysis of generalized linear models, a verication
on which of these factors inuence postoperative infection is presented. The
quantitative analysis by descriptive and inferential methods over through the chi-
square test further of the generalized linear models via logistic regression were
used with the support of the R software, bringing complementary information and
the discussion of results.


2. Materials and Methods
   The data used are referring to 113 patients that were submitted to dental
surgery in a specialized clinic in the city of Piracicaba between 2003 and 2018. The
preoperative protocols used are prophylactic and preemptive, which are described
below:

i. Prophylactic protocol: 1 gram of Cephalexin was used 2 hours before surgery
      and 1 gram 6 hours after the rst dose. In the corticoid regime, two
      possibilities were considered: intramuscular injectable (IM) use of 1 ampoule
      of Celestone soluspan, 15 minutes before surgery, or the use of 8 or 12 mg
      doses of dexamethasone via oral (VO), 2 hours before surgery. Patients
      were also instructed to realize yawn with 0.12% chlorhexidine starting 1 or
      2 days before surgery. For the postoperative period, anti-inammatory and
      analgesics were recommended, if necessary.

ii. Preemptive protocol: 500 mg cefadroxil was used starting of prophylactic
      form with 1 gram, 2 hours before surgery and maintained for every 12h for
      up to 5 days. In the corticoid regime, two possibilities were considered:
      intramuscular injectable (IM) use of 1 ampoule of Celestone soluspan, 15
      minutes before surgery, or the use of 8 or 12 mg doses of dexamethasone via
      oral (VO), 2 hours before surgery.

   The surgeries were performed by the same surgeon, following rigid asepsis and
antisepsis standards and using sterile gloves. The drugs and antibiotics used were

chosen according to the rules for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, observing their
eective spectrum of action against the germs commonly present in the oral cavity.
Furthermore, using rst-generation cephalosporins, cephalexin in prophylaxis,
due to its short dosage period, and cefadroxil 500 mg in preemptive treatment,
as recommended by the Ministry of Health regarding the use of prophylactic
antibiotics. The predominant factor for indicating a protocol is associated with
the degree of diculty of the surgery or the number of elements to be extracted
in a single session, considering the surgical time and magnitude of the surgical
trauma. In patients with a history of allergy to cephalosporin or penicillin, who
presented a beta-lactam ring, clindamycin 300 mg was used.
    Surgical sequence values were: 38, 28, 48, and 18, as shown in Figure 1, when
the 4 elements are extracted in a single session by standardization. In the surgeries,
multiplier pieces with external irrigation without the use of high rotation were
used, and all the principles of intra and extra oral asepsis and antisepsis were
followed, with the use of sterile elds.

    The characteristics of the patients were recorded. The variable of interest
(response variable) Y : Postoperative infection (0 = no, 1 = yes) is presented,
in addition to the covariates:

 X1 : Gender (0 = female, 1 = male);
 X2 : Age (in years);
 X3 : Number of extracted teeth (1, 2, 3, 4, and > 4);
 X4 : Type of preoperative protocol (0 = prophylactic, 1 = preemptive);
 X5 : Surgery Complication (0 = without complications,
      1 = with complications);
 X6 : Surgery diculty degree (0 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high);
 X7 : Type of drug treatment (0 = celestone, 1 = dexamethasone).

    Based on these covariates we can evaluate the eectiveness of protocols; to
verify the complications according to the diculty/surgical time; and as the use of
treatments applied to patients undergoing surgery. Also, it was observed how these
characteristics inuence the variable of interest, i.e., the occurrence of infections.
    Descriptive analyses were carried out to obtain more information about the
data. Subsequently, the chi-square test of independence was used, because the
interest was to study the relationship between the covariates, two by two, following
their assumptions.
    As there is an interest in describing some existing association between the
covariates and the variable response infection, the regression model was chosen, in
particular, the generalized linear model (GLM) via logistic regression, because the
response variable is of binary type with more than one covariate. The command
glm is available in R Software for the adjustment of the generalized linear model
to binary data.
     The response variable used Postoperative infection is dichotomous with the
levels: with infection dental (yi = 1) and no infection (yi = 0) for each patient
i : 1, . . . , 113. In this context, we are considering that Yi ∼ Bernoulli (πi ); where
πi is the probability that the ith patient presents the response under investigation,
i.e., P(Yi = 1) = πi for i : 1, . . . , 113. The systematic component represents
the information to the researcher about the phenomenon. This information
is translated by the combination of parameters and covariates expressed by:
η = β0 + β1 X1 + · · · + βp Xp , where: η indicates the linear predictor; Xi is the
covariates vector of the design matrix X ; η = (β0 , β1 , . . . , βk )T is the vector of
unknown parameters to be estimated and p represents the number of parameters.
   As the Bernoulli distribution was assumed as the response variable, the link
functions g −1 (π) used were: probit, logit, and complementary log-log. The use of
the three link functions is justied by the unbalance in the proportion of patients
about the infection response variable. However, in this case for didactic purposes,
only the logistic model was presented.
   The logistic regression is one of the best-known methods and is applied in
several knowledge areas, among them Biology, as analyzed in Javali & Pandit
(2012), which veried the dependence of oral health diseases, dental caries, and
periodontal disease through the application of the logistic regression model.
    Starting from the fact that Yi is a binary response variable, we assume the
following logistic regression model to associate the covariates Xi with the response
variable, so that:

                        Yi ∼ Bernoulli (πi );            i = 1, 2, . . . , 113.
                                         exp(β0 +β1 X1 +···+βp Xp )
                      πi = E(Yi |Xi ) = 1+exp(β 0 +β1 X1 +···+βp Xp )
                                                                      .

      Using the logit link function we have:
                                              
                 logit(πi ) = log        πi
                                        1−πi       = β0 + β1 X1i + · · · + βp Xpi .

    The command family = binomial(link =′ logit′ ) is available in R Software
for the adjustment of the generalized linear model to binary data with the logit
link function.
    To indicate which model is more suitable for the data, the Akaike information
criterion (AIC) was introduced. Also, the deviation analysis was used to test the
signicance of the inclusion of new covariates in the embedded models or their
possible interactions, in order to verify which of these is the most appropriate for
the data set under study. The anova command of R Software provides a table of
deviation analysis. More information in Nelder & Wedderburn (1972), Cordeiro
& Neto (2004), Cordeiro & Demétrio (1986) and Moral et al. (2017).
    An important step after modeling is the residual analysis because from this
it is possible to verify the assumptions of the proposed model. According to the
author Cordeiro & Neto (2004), the residuals in the GLM's are used to explore
the suitability of the tted model concerning the link function and linear predictor
terms in addition to identifying outliers. For the residuals analysis in this work,
the normal graph of probabilities with simulation envelope was used (Moral et al.,
2017) via the command hnp.


3. Results and Discussion
   To obtain more information about the data set under study, a descriptive
analysis was initially performed, being the results summarized in Tables 1 and 2
and in Figures 2 and 3. It was found that from the 113 patients under study,
95 (84%) had no infection, while 18 patients (16%) had the infection, evidencing
an imbalance in the proportion of these patients about the variable of interest.
Furthermore, it was observed that the relative frequencies of the covariates studied
in Table 1 have mostly close values, initially indicating descriptively that these
covariates do not have distinct results for patients with or without infection.
    Regarding the covariate patient's age, it was observed that the measures of
central tendency such as the mean, median, quartiles, and of variability such as
the coecient of variation (CV), showed dierent behaviors for the patients with
and without infection, being also observed that the age distribution represented
by Figure 2 showned a distinct behavior with atypical observations for both types
of patients.
    As for the covariate number of teeth extracted, most patients removed four
teeth regardless of the presence of infection or not. Although the number of
teeth extracted was higher in individuals who did not have an infection, which
corresponds to a frequency of 54 observations when compared to patients with
infection who have a frequency of 11 observations, in percentage terms the results
become more similar, that is, the percentage of individuals without infection
and with infection who extracted four teeth correspond to 56.84% and 61.12%,
respectively, as presented in Figure 3.

    Table 3 presents an analysis to verify the existence of any association between
the covariates using the chi-square test. It was observed that the Number of teeth
extracted (X3 ) has an association with the Degree of diculty of surgery (X6 );
Type of preoperative protocol (X4 ) has an association with the Degree of diculty
of surgery (X6 ) and Type of drug treatment (X7 ), and that Degree of diculty of
surgery (X6 ) has a relationship with Type of drug treatment (X7 ). The reason for
this association is justied by the fact that the p-value was less than the adopted
α signicance level of 10%.

    According to the researchers' guidelines, it was dened that the variable degree
of diculty (X6 ) would be removed from the analysis. Therefore, the covariates
used in the analysis were: Gender (X1 ); Age (X2 ); Number of teeth extracted
(X3 ); Type of preoperative protocol (X4 ); Complication during surgery (X5 ) and
Type of drug treatment (X7 ).
    Since the results of the probit, logit, and complementary log-log link functions
were similar, it was decided to use the logistic link function under the following
structure:
                      
                  πi
  (πi ) = log            = β0 + β1 X1i + β2 X2i + β3 X3i + β4 X4i + β5 X5i + β6 X6i ;
                1 − πi
where i = 1, 2, . . . , 113.

    The estimated values with their respective p-values of the model with logit
link function were presented in Table 4 and through this, it was observed that
besides the intercept, the covariates: Age; the Number of teeth extracted, and
Complication in surgery were relevant at the 10% level of signicance.

   Based on the fact that the covariates Age, Number of teeth extracted and
surgical complication were relevant, we considered some submodels individually
and their possible combinations to verify if they t the data well result 10 candidate
models Mj ; j = 1, 2 . . . , 10. As the 10 candidate models are tted, the dierence
analysis of the deviations was used to verify whether the proposed models ts
the data. Tables 5, 6 and 7 present the results regarding three tted model
congurations using the logit link function. Through the tables, we can see that
models 4 and 10 initially show satisfactory evidence of dental data, as the candidate
models presented a p-value lower than 10%.

   Therefore the nal regression model for binary data is represented in the form:
                             
   logit(πi ) = log 1−π  πi
                            i
                                = −5.36 + 0.07 Agei + 0.56 Number of extracted teethi ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , 113.
    Considering the use of the logistic model, some interpretations can be made
on the estimated parameters, such as the odds ratio. Therefore, for the variables
Age and Number of extracted teeth, the odds ratios are interpreted as follows: the
odds of getting an infection for each year of age is exp(0.07) = 1.07; if there was
interest in a larger interval in the dierence, for example, 4 years, in that case, for
each increase in 4 years, the chance of getting the infection is exp(4 × 0.07) = 1.32
and the odds of getting an infection for each extracted tooth is exp(0.56) = 1.76.

4. Conclusions
    In this study, the generalized linear model via logistic regression was used to
verify whether, in addition to the medication protocols presented, some covariates
frequently used in dental surgeries inuence the response variable, occurrence or
not of infection. Through the methodologies used, it was observed that only the
variables age and number of extracted teeth were signicant about the variable
Infection. This result corroborates other research in the area (Santosh, 2015;
Alsaedi, 2021), in which the patient's age and the number of extracted teeth have
inuence on inammatory processes after surgery and occurrence of infection. The
logit link function was chosen due to the greater ease of interpreting the parameters
and because of its recurrent use in scientic articles in the dental eld.
