Abstract
Some ecient product type exponential imputation methods are proposed in this article to tackle the problem of incomplete values in sampling theory. To investigate the eectiveness of proposed exponential methods, the behaviours of the considered estimators are compared in two scenarios: with and without nonresponse. The simulation studies show that the proposed resultant estimators outperform other existing estimators in this literature.

1. Introduction

      In sampling theory, imputation is an appealing strategy for analysing missing
data.      In order to successfully handle the missing values in survey data, Sande
(1979) selected imputation strategies that aggregate missing data sets consistently
and make simple and direct analysis. In a very nice way Heitjan & Basu (1996)
distinguished, the meanings of MAR (missing at random) and MCAR (missing
completely at random) were delineated.                 Hyunshik Lee & S√§rndal (1994), Lee
et al. (1995) for purpose of the imputation, employed the auxiliary information.
Using MCAR response mechanism, Ahmed et al. (2006), Singh & Horn (2000),
Toutenburg et al. (2008), Singh (2009), Singh et al. (2010), Singh et al. (2016),


                            a                   b
Gira (2015), Kadilar & Cingi (2008), Diana & Francesco Perri (2010), Prasad
(2017), Prasad (2018 ), Prasad (2018 ), Prasad (2019), Prasad (2021) have pro-
posed numerous new imputation techniques in sampling theory.

           If the study and auxiliary variables have a negative coecient of correlation,
then the product methods of imputation have been used for missing data. Singh &
Deo (2003), consider the product approach of imputation to be extremely eective.
There are Multiple social science or medical variables that decreases as people
grow older. For examples, when peoples get older, then following factors exhibit
a negative correlations with the age:               (a) visual acuity, (b) head hair density,
(c) hearing capabilities, and so on. In sampling theory, the product imputation
technique is useful if in-formations on any of the studied variable is unavailable
but the ages of the subjects is accessible.

           Motivated by the above work of Singh & Deo (2003), to deal with the
problem of incomplete values in sampling theory, and four ecient product type
exponential imputation approaches have been proposed. The proposed estimator's
behaviour is examined in two conditions (with and without nonresponse), and
conclusions are drawn.

           The remaining sections of the manuscript are organised as follows:                 We
provided the various notations used in this manuscript in Section 2. In Section
3, we looked at a review of existing methods in the literature. In Section 4, we
proposed four product-type exponential estimators and derived expressions for
their bias and MSE. In Sections 5 and 6, we conducted a numerical illustration
and simulation study. Section 7 contains an analysis of the numerical illustration
and simulation study. We arrived at conclusions in Section 8.

3. Some Existing Methods

   Some imputation methods that are commonly used are as follows.



3.1. Mean Imputation Approach

   After imputation, data in this technique have the following structure:

                                          
                                                yi , iœµA
                                  y.i =                                                (1)
                                                yÃÑr , iœµAc

Under this approach, the resultant point estimator of YÃÑ takes the form

                                                    r
                                                 1X
                                      yÃÑr =            yi                              (2)
                                                 r i=1

And variance of response sample mean yÃÑr , is calculated using the following:

                                                        
                                                 1   1
                              V ar(yÃÑr ) =         ‚àí           YÃÑ 2 Cy2                (3)
                                                 r   N

where yÃÑr and Cy are the response sample mean and correspondingly, the coe-
cients of variation having the studied variable y .



3.2. Singh and Deo (2003) Approach

   In sampling theory, Singh & Deo (2003) proposed the product imputation
approach. After imputation, data in this approach take the following structure:

                              Ô£±
                              Ô£¥
                              Ô£≤                                 yi ,   iœµA
                      y.i =        h         i                                         (4)
                              Ô£≥ yÃÑ nxÃÑr ‚àírxÃÑn P xi
                              Ô£¥
                                                                   ,   iœµAc
                                  r       xÃÑn                 c xi
                                                        iœµR




                 Revista Colombiana de Estad√≠stica - Theorical Statistics 46 (2023) 111-127

In this method, the resultant point estimator of YÃÑ becomes

                                                    yÃÑr
                                        yÃÑSD =          xÃÑr                                 (5)
                                                    xÃÑn
where xÃÑr and xÃÑn having response and sample mean of variables x respectively.

       The MSE of this estimator, is as follows
                                                             
                                                    1   1
                                                                  Cx2 + 2œÅCy Cx YÃÑ 2
                                                                               
                 M SE(yÃÑSD ) = V ar(yÃÑr ) +           ‚àí                                     (6)
                                                    r   n
where Cx ,     Cy and œÅ are the coecient of variation of variable x, coecient of
variation of variable y and correlation coecient between the variables y and x
simultaneously.




4. Proposed Imputation Methods

       With auxiliary variables X and study variables Y , a nite population of size N
was considered. In this article, let the values of the auxiliary variables be negatively
correlated with the values of the study variates. We have population coecient
of skewness Œ≤1 (x) and coecient of kurtosis Œ≤2 (x) of an auxiliary variables are
supposed to be known. Now, random sample of size n is drawn according to the
SRSWOR schemes process to estimate the population mean of the study variables
YÃÑ .
       Assume that the nonresponse is random and that the numbers of responding
unit out of a sample of n unit is represented by r . Let A represent the number of
                          c
responding unit and A         denote the number of nonresponding unit.

       Whenever the nonresponse observation are discarded, it is customary to esti-
mates the population mean YÃÑ , is given in equation (2).

       When the nonresponse observation are not discarded and We have some im-
putation Approach are followed,then the completes data set is as:
                                            
                                                yi ,     iœµA
                                    y.i =                                                   (7)
                                                yÀúi ,    iœµAc
The point estimators of the population mean takes the form:

                                 n
                                            "             #
                              1X          1 X      X
                           œÑ=       y.i =     yi +    yÀúi                                   (8)

                                                                                             th
Where, yÀúi represent the imputed values of study variable corresponding to the i
nonresponding unit.

       If product type exponential imputation methods are imputed for missing values
of study variate, there are four simple choices of yÀúi in equation (8), we have

real data sets (given in Table 1) for taking the sample population of size                    (n)
between 33% to 40% and response rate (r), are between 60% to 92% and performs
some numerical study to evaluates performance of the considered estimators.

    Now, the percent relative losses in eciency of the suggested estimators œÑi

to study the eects of nonresponse on the precision of estimates under sampling

6. Simulation Study

      We demonstrate the performance of all estimators by generating random num-
ber from bi-variate normal distribution by using R-Software Team et al. (2021).
The auxiliary information on variable X has been generated by articial data set's
having population size N = 5000 generated from bi-variate normal distribution for
(X, Y ) having negative correlation between Study variables and auxiliary variable.
This type of population is very relevant in most socio-economic situation with our
interest.

      The model under which the populations are generated is given below

             Y ‚Üê s2 p(X ‚àí m1)/s1 + m2 + s2 rnorm(N, 0, sqrt(1 ‚àí p2 ))
where rnorm() in R Team et al. (2021) is a built-in function that generates a vector
of normally distributed random numbers, sqrt() function in the R programming
language is used to determine the square-root of a value that is passed to it as
an argument, N is the population size, m1 and m2 are the means of variables X
and Y respectively, s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of variables X and Y
respectively, and p is the correlation coecient between the variables X and Y .
This setting is used to generate bivariate normal numbers between (X, Y ).

      By using the generated random variables, the PRL and PRE of our considered
estimators œÑi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) in the respect to another suggested estimators Œæi (i =
1, 2, 3, 4) are calculated and shown in Tables 5-7. Based on the simulation studies,
We have observed that the our considered estimators are more eective than the
compared estimators in this literature.

8. Conclusions

      In the present article, four ecient product type exponential estimators with
imputation œÑi    (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are considered in sampling theory to estimate the
population mean of the study variable.           According to the Tables 2 and 5, for
the xed values of sample population, the values of               P RLi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) now
decrease with the increasing values of response rate.              This behaviour indicates
that the higher the correlation coecient between the auxiliary variables and study
variables, the fewer fresh samples are required in sampling theory, and the amount
of loss in precision also decreases.      The behaviour of the proposed estimators
are well supported by numerical illustrations and simulation studies presented in
Tables 2-7 for taking dierent values of sample population and response rate. It is
shows that the proposed estimators are more eective than the mean imputation
approach and Singh & Deo (2003) estimator in this literature.

      Based on analysis of numerical and simulation studies, one may conclude that
using the population coecient of skewness Œ≤1 (x) and coecient of kurtosis Œ≤2 (x)
of as auxiliary variables in developing methods of imputation and, as a result, its
application in proposed estimators are extremely valuable in terms of estimate
precision and survey cost reduction.
