University of Jammu, Jammu, India
Abstract
In the present study, we explore the problem of estimation of nite population variance in simple random sampling (without replacement) by utilizing information of two auxiliary variables. A ratio cum exponential estimator has been proposed and its properties are studied to the rst degree of approximation. To demonstrate the eciency, members of the proposed estimator as well as other existing estimators are compared to the usual unbiased estimator. To study the performance, a simulation study is undertaken for both real and articial population using R software. The suggested estimator is found to be more ecient than other existing estimators in terms of having minimum MSE.

Resumen
En el presente estudio, exploramos el problema de la estimaciÃ³n de la varianza de una poblaciÃ³n nita en un muestreo aleatorio simple (sin reemplazo) utilizando la informaciÃ³n de dos variables auxiliares. Se ha propuesto un estimador de razÃ³n cum exponencial y se estudian sus propiedades hasta el primer grado de aproximaciÃ³n. Para demostrar la eciencia, los miembros del estimador propuesto, asÃ­ como otros estimadores existentes, se comparan con el estimador insesgado habitual. Usando el software R, se lleva a cabo un anÃ¡lisis de simulaciÃ³n para respaldar las conclusiones teÃ³ricas. Se determina que el estimador sugerido es mÃ¡s eciente que otros estimadores existentes segÃºn el anÃ¡lisis del estudio de simulaciÃ³n.

1. Introduction
    In the theory of survey sampling, it is unanimously accepted that the appro-
priate use of auxiliary information improves the eciency of the estimators of the
population parameter under consideration for the variable of interest. The ratio,
product, and regression estimators are well-known examples. Such estimators take
advantage of the correlation between the auxiliary variable(s) and the study varia-
ble; vide Murthy (1967) and Das (1988). Isaki (1983) proposed ratio estimator,
usually known as a classical estimator of the nite population variance. Kadilar
& Cingi (2006) extended the idea of Isaki (1983) ratio estimator for population
variance by utilizing the information available about the coecient of variation
and coecient of kurtosis of the auxiliary variable under simple random sampling.
Gupta & Shabbir (2008) gave a hybrid class of variance estimator. Subramani
& Kumarapandiyan (2012) further developed the usual ratio-type variance esti-
mators using lower and upper quartiles, inter-quartile range, quartile deviation,
and quartile average of the auxiliary variables. Further, Subramani & Kumara-
pandiyan (2013) developed more ecient modied ratio-type estimators using me-
dian and coecient of variation of the auxiliary variable. Some recent signicant
contributions in this direction include Bhushan et al. (2021) and Shabbir et al.
(2022).
    Variations may be seen in almost every sphere of human life. According to
the law of nature, no two objects or people are exactly the same. For example,
a doctor must have a thorough knowledge of the uctuations in human blood
pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate to prescribe properly. In addition, to
ensure the productivity of the crop, an agriculturist must understand the dierent
climatic factors that aect the climate. Many practical situations arise where the
problem of estimation of population variance of the study variable is needed. Some
modied and ecient class of estimators for population variance using auxiliary
attributes are given by Bhushan et al. (2021) and Bhushan et al. (2022).
    Usually, the ratio estimators do not work eciently in situations when the rela-
tionship between the auxiliary and study variables is not linear. In such situations,
the exponential product and ratio estimators proposed by Bahl & Tuteja (1991)
are used. Bahl & Tuteja (1991) suggested new exponential ratio and product type
estimators for estimating the population mean of the study variable using auxiliary
information. In the present paper, we propose a ratio-cum-exponential estimator
for population variance of the study variable using the information on an auxiliary
variable(s) that is(are) correlated with the study variable and have shown that the
suggested estimator is more ecient than the existing estimators.
    Further, the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we have discussed
some existing estimators and used notations are dened. The proposed estimator
along with its properties are discussed in section 3. In section 4, we compare
the proposed estimator with the usual and other considered existing estimators
and the eciency conditions are developed. Section 5 provides a simulation study
to check the eectiveness of the proposed estimator. At Last, the conclusion is
discussed in section 6.

2. Notations and Existing Estimators
      A sample of size n is selected from a nite population P = (P1 , P2 , . . . , PN )
of size N by using a simple random sampling without replacement to estimate
the population variance. Let Y denote the study variable, and X and Z are the
auxiliary variables. Here, we use the following notations:
YÌ„ : the population mean of study variable.
XÌ„ & ZÌ„ : the population mean of auxiliary variables.
Sy2 , Sx2 and Sz2 : the population variances of the study variable Y and auxiliary
variables X & Z , respectively.
s2y , s2x and s2z : the sample variances of the study variable y , and auxiliary variables
x and z , respectively.
    We dene expectations in order to get the mean square errors of suggested
estimators.
     s2y = Sy2 (1 + ey ), s2x = Sx2 (1 + ex ) and s2z = Sz2 (1 + ez ). E(ey ) = E(ex ) =
E(ez ) = 0. E(e2y ) = f (Î»400 âˆ’ 1), E(e2x ) = f (Î»040 âˆ’ 1), E(e2z ) = f (Î»004 âˆ’ 1),
E(ey ex ) = f (Î»220 âˆ’ 1), E(ey ez ) = f (Î»202 âˆ’ 1), E(ez ex ) = f (Î»022 âˆ’ 1)

where f = ( n1 âˆ’ N1 ), g = N nâˆ’n , Î»rsq = r/2 s/2 q/2 and Âµrsq =                   (Yi âˆ’

YÌ„ )r (Xi âˆ’ XÌ„)s (Zi âˆ’ ZÌ„)q , (r, s and q) are non-negative integer and Âµ200 , Âµ020 and
Âµ002 are the second order moment, and Î»rsq is the moment ratio.
     Some existing estimators are dened as:

as

An Improved Estimator of Finite Population Variance                                      85

3. Proposed Estimator
    It is known that exponential-type estimators perform better than comparable
standard ratio and product-type estimators in terms of less mean square errors in
a situation when the relationship between the auxiliary and study variables is not
linear. As a result, the issue arises when the parameters that favor exponential-
type estimators over standard estimators are not easily satised. The development
of other eective estimators that would perform better than both the conventional
exponential and standard estimators would be the obvious solution. Taking mo-
tivation from previous research and following the work of Yasmeen et al. (2019),
we developed a ratio cum exponential estimator for estimating the nite popula-
tion variance of study variables y by utilizing two auxiliary variables under simple
random sampling, which is specied as
                      2 Î±0  2 Î±1     "                         #

             TM = s2y x2       z
                                     exp     x       x    z      z
                                                                                       (10)

where, Î±0 and Î±1 are two unknown constants and their values must be determined
so that MSE can be minimized.

                  TM = Sy2 (1 + ey )(1 + ex )Î±0 (1 + ez )Î±1 exp(ex ez )                (11)

On simplifying and expanding the exponential function and ignoring the terms
with a power greater than two, then we get
                   h
  (TM âˆ’ Sy2 ) = Sy2 ey + Î±0 ex + Î±1 ez + Î±0 Î±1 ex ez + Î±1 ez ey + Î±0 ex ey + ex ez
                                             1                                  i
                                           + (Î±12 âˆ’ Î±1 )e2z + (Î±02 âˆ’ Î±0 )e2x       (12)
                                             2
Taking Expectation on both side of equation (12), we get the bias of proposed
estimator TM as
                                h
   B(TM ) = E(TM âˆ’ Sy2 ) = f Sy2 Î±0 Î±1 (Î»022 âˆ’ 1) + Î±1 (Î»202 âˆ’ 1) + Î±0 (Î»220 âˆ’ 1)
                                1 2                                            i
                +(Î»022 âˆ’ 1) +     (Î±1 âˆ’ Î±1 )(Î»004 âˆ’ 1) + (Î±02 âˆ’ Î±0 )(Î»040 âˆ’ 1)
                                2
                                                                                (13)

Squaring and taking expectation on both side of equation (12), the mean square
error of TM is given as
                                    h
   M SE(TM ) = E(TM âˆ’ Sy2 )2 = f Sy4 (Î»400 âˆ’ 1) + Î±02 (Î»040 âˆ’ 1) + Î±12 (Î»004 âˆ’ 1)
                                                                                i
                         +2Î±0 (Î»220 âˆ’ 1) + 2Î±0 Î±1 (Î»022 âˆ’ 1) + 2Î±1 (Î»202 âˆ’ 1)
                                                                                       (14)
The minimum mean square error of the proposed estimator is obtained by diffe-
rentiating equation (14) with respect to unknown constant Î±0 and Î±1 , respectively
and equating to zero, then we get the optimum value of unknown constant as

After substituting the optimum value of Î±0 and Î±1 , the minimum mean square

5. Simulation Study
    This section describes how we performed a simulation to examine the perfor-
mance of the proposed estimator TM against the usual and other existing estima-
tors using R software for both articial and real-life data.
   For an articial population, we constructed a population of size N = 100 and
took dierent sample sizes as n = 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70, using the non-linear model
Y = exp(X) + exp(Z) + rnorm(N, 0.05, 0.45), where X = rnorm(N, 0.05, 0.45)
and Z = rnorm(N, 0.05, 0.45). As a result, we iterated over 100 times the average
values of the statistics used to simulate the simulated data1 .

                1        -1      155.2657   99.8137     66.5424 44.3616    28.5182

   In Table 2, substitute the dierent values of Î±0 and Î±1 in equation (15) i.e., the
minimum MSE of the estimator. As the sample size increases, the value of MSEs
decreases. Various estimators develop when we use dierent values of constant,
and the MSE of all these estimators is greater than our proposed estimator. Then,
we can clearly say that our proposed estimator is more ecient than the other
members of the estimator.
    In Table 3, we compare the proposed estimator with the usual unbiased estima-
tor and other conventional estimators. It is visible from Table 3 that the proposed
estimator is better than all the other existing estimators. With the increase in the
sample size, the MSEs of all the considered estimators are decreases, but the MSE
of the proposed estimator TM rst increased and then decreased. The MSE of the
estimators T5 and T3 have a greater MSE, which means the estimators T5 and T3
are less ecient than all the other estimators.

    To test the proposed estimator's real-world applicability, we use the HBAT
real-data set, which is a prominent maker of paper goods in the US. From this
data set, we choose Likely to Purchase as a study variable (y ), Satisfaction,
and Delivery Speed as auxiliary variables (x and z ), respectively. Here, the po-
pulation size N = 200 and dierent samples are drawn to compare the performance
of the proposed estimator to that of conventional and other existing estimators.

    From Table 4, It is envisaged that for dierent samples our proposed estimator
is highly ecient than the usual and other existing estimators. As the sample
size increases, the MSE of estimator TM rst increase then decrease, and again
increases then decreases. Furthermore, the MSE of estimators T1 , T2 , T4 , T5 , T6 ,
T7 , T8 and T9 reduces as the sample size increases, whereas T3 increases. The
estimator T3 is less ecient than all the other estimators. The performance of all
estimators indicates T3 > T5 > T2 > T9 > T8 > T6 > T4 > T7 > T1 > TM .

6. Conclusion
   In this article, we have proposed a ratio cum exponential estimator using two
auxiliary variables under simple random sampling for the estimation of the nite
population variance. The properties of the proposed estimator have been studied
up to the rst degree of approximation and we compared the results with respect to
the usual unbiased estimator and other existing estimators. By using R software,
both real and articial generated populations are used for the simulation study.
From the simulation results, we determine that our suggested estimator is more
ecient than the usual and the other conventional estimators. Thus, we may
recommend the use of our proposed estimator in a practical situation.
