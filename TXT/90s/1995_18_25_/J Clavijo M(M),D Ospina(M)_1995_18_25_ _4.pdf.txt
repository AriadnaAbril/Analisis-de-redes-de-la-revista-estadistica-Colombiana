INTRODUCTION
The sample siie is a crucial aspect of statistical research since it must be large enough to guarantee the prefíxed confidence level for the estimations and as small as

possible to minimize the costs.

   The determination of samiple size is a probiem of difficult solution using analytic

methods. Generally, researchers make use of the central limit theorem, the law of laurge

numbers or the Chcbychev inequaUty. However, in mamy cases the values obtadned

with these methods are laage and the budget assigned to the study is too smadl to

satisfy them. Financial restrictions are, usually, the main reason to look for new

procedures.

   In this article, some mathematical results, derived from weU-known generad con-

cepts, as well as certain simulation techniques, are used to deternúne those mínima

                                                                            Typeset by AM^-TpX

valúes that support the normal approximation in the estimation process of means

for bounded symmetric distributions. The final results show the convenience of the

methodology used which could be implemented with other problems of similar carac-

teristics.


                              2. PRELIMINARY THEORY


     For theoretical convenience this paper has been oriented to bounded symmetric

distributions which possess an unique extreme valué -máximum or mínimum- within

an open interval {a,b).

     Any probability distribution F whose density function / is continous, symmetric

and defined on an interval of finite lenght [a,b], will be called B o u n d e d Symmetric

Distribution,

     As a basic theoretic concept to develop the task, the claissic kurtosis has been

chosen since many authors like Finucan, Chisom, Darüngton amd Meeden [1] consider

it to be a definitive element in the determination of the distribution shape. Van Zweet

[1] considers the kurtosis inherent to the nature of the symmetric distributions and

has introduced a partial order within the family of such distributions which is directly

related to the kurtosis values corresponding to each of them. This order is established

in [1] as foilows:


Deñnition 1. (Van Zweet's ordering) Given / and g symmetric distributions, it is

said that f < g if and only if g~^{f(x)) is convex for x > mj where mj is the

symmetry point of / .


     The symmetry of the functions implies in particular that g~^{f{x)) is convex for

X > mj \f and only if it is concave for x < m j .

   Van Zweet himself demonstrated that the foliowing order of increasing dominance

is fullfíled for these distributions:


U-Shaped      <    Uniform      <       Normal   <   Logistic   <   Double Exponential'


   Another result, also due to Vam Zweet, that constitutes an important element for

this paper, estabüshes that if / < j then 7 ( / ) < 7(3) , where 7 represents the classic

kurtosis, deñned as the quotient between the fourth centrad moment and the square

of the variance.

   Finucan [1] showed that if / amd g are symmetric distributions with O meam and

equal variance and if the graph of g{x) — f{x) has the trend "pcak-trough-peak"

when X increases, then y{f) < y{g). This result is known as Finacon's Principie. The

goal is to combine Van Zweet's results with Finucan's Principie to obtain a íamily of

distributions that cam be used in the solution of the probiem described above.


                                    3. A SOLUTION PLAN


   Since Finucan's Principie is appUcable to symmetric distributions with mean O, the

probiem for arbitrary distributions must be translated to centered distributions (at

the origin) and it must be shown that the basic properties of such distributions are

not adfected by translations.


T h e o r e m 1. Let X be a continuous random variable with density function f{x)

deñned on an interval [a,b] and let Y be a random variabJe defined by Y = X -^-1

with density function g{y), deñned on [a -H /,6 -|- í]. Then Pr{X) = Pr{Y) for I e R

and r = 1,2,3,..., where pr represents the r"" centra/ moment.


Proof. y = t{x) = X -\- ¡ and x = v{y) = y - / are continuous monotonic fimctions.

Then (Cfr. [2], page 277) g{y) can be written as:


           9{y) = fiv{y))\v'iy)\ = f{v{y)) = f { y - l )       for     a-^/<y<5 + /


where Iv'íy)! stands for the absolute vadue of the first derivalive of v{y). Similarly,


                f{x) = g{tix))\t'ix)\ = gitix)) = g(x-^l)            for   a<x<b


From here, through the change of variable y = x -\-l:


                              f^'riY) = í         y'giy)dy
                                        Ja-^-t

                                      = í {x-^lYgix-\-l)dx
                                        Ja
                                      = / {x-¥iyfix)dx
                                        Ja

Partlcularly,

                           ti'iiY) = u J xf{x)dx = p\{X)-Vl

an d
                                     p\{X) = p ' i { Y ) - l


Finally,


                             Pr{Y) = ^{Y-p'i{Y)r
                                        ,b->r\
                                    = 1          {y-p'i{Y)yg{y)dy

                                    = j^{x-p'i{x)yf{x)dx

                                    = /^r(A)


     It can be concluded that, under tramslations, the distribution moments remain

unchanged. In particular, the variances and kurtosis remain equal.

Definition 2. let 5 be the class of all symmetric distributions, bounded and definable

on M. lt will be saúd that / and g are similar if jr is a translation of / .

T h e o r e m 2. The simiiarity deñned between eiements of^ is an equivalence relation.

   This theorem, with inmediate proof, allows us to consider the symmetric, bounded,

defined on [—o, a] and centered at the origin distributions as rcpresentatives of the

equivalence classes. Therefore, what can be said for one such distribution -related to

its shape- is applicable to aU the class members. In particular, these distributions

satisfy Finucam's Principie. This fact, besides the pairtiad order introduced by Van

Zweet, allows us to extend the dominance range for symmetric distributions centered

at the origin, as foilows.



         U- Shaped Distrib          <        Uniform Distrib       <    D- Shaped Distrib


   And keeping in mind what was saúd for the kurtosis, it is also true that:


                             7(U)       <      7(Uniform)      <       7(n)


                              4.    TRIANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS


   The symmetric triangular distributions with mean O play an importamt role in

this work since they cam be situated between the uniform distributions and the U or

n — shaped distributions. These distributions may be defined, based on a parameter

t which varies on the interval [0,1], by the foliowing expressions:

   1. Density function:

                                    í ^ - ^ * .          if    -a<x<0
                       fix) = { í + ^ x ,                if    Q<x<a
                                        0.               in other case

     2. Moments:



                       - ^ = {0:                              if    r   is odd

     3. Variance:
                                          2      23-2<


     4. Kurtosis:
                                           12 (5 - At)
                                       7 = 5 (3 - 2í)2

     5. Cumulative distribution function:

                            O,                                     if   X< -a
                           Hx + « ) - « l ( i " - < . ' ) ,        if   -a<z<0
               ' ' M = . l 2+ •1 o. ' + 12o'^ . .                  if   0<r <a
                            1,                                     if   X> a

     The above distributions can be classified in two groups, as foilows:

     a) Concave, when < < 5

     b) Convex, when í > 5

       The case < = 5 corresponds to the uniform distribution.

     The combination of Finucan's Principie and Van Zweet's ordering allows us to

establish the foliowing relation:




                7(U) < 7(Acóncave) < 7(Uniform) < 7(Aconvex) < 7(11)


     íYom the simulations performed (see table) it can be concluded that there must

 exist an inverse relation (in the sense that while one increases the other decreases)

 between the kurtosis and the minimum sample size in order for it to be possible

 to use the normal approximation to estimate the distribution mean. Therefore, the

           NORMAL APPR, WHEN SAMPL. FROM BOUND. SYMM. DISTR.                         29

distributions that need a larger size are U-shaped, followed by concave triangular and

then by uniform. According to this, the convex triangular distributions can be used

to determine the minimum sample sizes to estimate the meam. These sizes usuadly are

larger than the theoretic minimum established by the classical statistical Uterature

which guarantees the estimation within a proposed confidence level.


                              5. SIMULATION AND RESULTS


  The simulation, using Monte Cario methods (Cfr [3] and [4]), was carried out

developing an algorithm which can be summarized in the foliowing steps: STEP 1.

Fix n as a smaU valué (30 is usually appropriate) STEP 2. Genérate 1000 random

samples of size n, from a symmetric triangular distribution deterlnined by a valué t

in the intervaü [0,1] STEP 3. Construct, for each sample, the 95% confidence interval

for the theoretic mean which is 0. This interval is given by:




where X is the sample mean, s^ is the sample variance and z the quamtile corres-

ponding to the prefixed confidence level (1.96 in this case). STEP 4. Verify if the

confidence interval contains the population mean and register a success in affirmative

case. STEP 5. If the number of successes is greater tham or equal to 950 (95% of

the cases) n is considered appropriate. If it is not, n is increased by one unit and the

process restarts at step 2.

     The program execution yielded a series of values which may be interpreted as

foilows:

     1, For bounded and convex symmetric distributions (bell - shaped), and even for

the uniform, a sample of 44 Ítems, randomly chosen, are enough to make use of the

normal approximation for the mean estimation with a 95% confidence level.

     2, The above valué may be compared with n = 30, suggested valué for normal or

approximated normal distributions, In this case, however, the fact that the distri-

bution is bounded has not been considered, as usually occurs for most situations in

actual Ufe.
