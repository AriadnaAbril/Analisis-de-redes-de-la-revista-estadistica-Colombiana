Nonstandard definition of the Stratonovich integral
Universidad Nacional de Colombia
ABSTRACT
By using the relation between the Ito integral and the Stratonovich integral, a nonstandard definition of the Stratonovich integral is given. For a good introduction of nonstandard analysis we can see Albeverio et
al,(1986). The main features needed in this work paper can been seen in M Munoz de Ozak (1997).
Introduction
The Stratonovich integral obeys the same rules as the Newton-Leibniz Cal-
culus. By using nonstandard analysis the Ito integral can be regarded as a
Riemann-Stieltjes sum (Anderson 1976). We used this result to give an easy
representation of the Stratonovich integral.
   Starting with two continuous, real d-dimensional semi-martingales                 we give
a nonstandard representation of the Stratonovich integral as

               St =   it
                       o
                           Y8X   =   L 1/2[Y(~ + ~t) + Y(~)]~X(~)
                                     s<:
for X, Y S-continuous internal semi-martingales and establish the existence of
its standard part which is then shown to correspond to the usual Stratonovich
integral

where x and yare continuous Jrsemi-martingales,                     and X and Yare       internal
semi-martingale liftings of x and y, respectively.

 2. Stratonovich       integral

      Let N E *N - N, define 6.t = 1/N;:::j 0. Let T be the hyper finite time line,

                  T = {O, 6.t, 26.t,···       , kt:J.t,··· } = {kt:J.t : k E *No}.

Let 23 the class of internal hyperfinite subsets of T and let 3: be the counting
measure on 23. Then (T, 23,3:) is an internal measurable space. Also, T is an
internal S-dense subset of * [0,00). We will also require another measurable
space (!1, 21,P), and will denote with (!1, L(21), L(P)) the corresponding Loeb
space.
   Let (M, p) be a complete metric space and denote with D(M) the set of cad-
lag functions f : [0,00) ---> M. We know that there is a unique topology, J1,
for which D(M) is polish space. In general we will denote with D this space,
when M = lR.
   Following Hoover and Perkins (1983), we find that the nearstandard                      points
in * D are of three kinds: SD, SDJ and S-continuous (SO).

1. Definition.       Let F E * D be such that FW               E ns(*JR)    for ~ E ns(*[O, 00)).
then:
       (a) F is of class SD iffor each t E [0,00) there are points h ;:::j h ;:::j t such
           that
              (i) If 1h ;::::t,:J!<1 ~ ~1 , then F(:J!<1);:::: F(h)·
             (ii) If:J!<2;:::j t,:J!<2 < -b then F(:J!<2) ;::::F(~2)'
      (b) F is of class SDJ or a larc lift, if (a) holds with h = ~2 and FW ;:::j F(O)
                       °
          for all ~;:::: in *[0,00).
      (c) F is S-continuous (SO) if FW;:::: F(:J!<) whenever ~;:::::J!<,~,:J!<E ns(T).

   If F : T ---> * M, F is SD (SDJ, SO) on T if it is the restriction to T of an
SD (SDJ, SO) function on *[0,00). For a function on T we can define a real
valued function st(F) by


                                   st(F)(t)      = lim FW. 0
                                                    "tlt
                                                    lET


In Hoover and Perkins (1983) it is shown that the class offunctions in * D which
are nearstandard in the h topology is SDJ, and that the function stlSDJ is
the nearstandard part for the J1 topology.

2. Definition. An internal stochastic process X is of class SD (SDl,                SC) if
for almost all w E 0, the mapping

                                           X(-,w):T---->·M

is of class SD (SDl,         SC).
   If X is SD, we can define a standard stochastic process with sample paths
in D as follows: fix z , E M and define

               st(X)(t,w){          st(X(-,w)){t),       if X(-,w)       IS   SD,
                                    z ,,                 otherwise,


3. Definition. An SD (SDl, SC) lifting of a stochastic process x: [0,(0) x
o ----> M is an internal stochastic process X of class SD (SDl, SC), X :
T x 0 ----> • M, such that st(X) and x are indistinguishable.
Remark 1. We can replace T by an S-dense set of ·[0. (0) in the above def-
initions. An internal filtration on 0 indexed by T is an internal increasing
collection of "sub-rr-fields of 21, {IFf.: ~ E T}. The standard part of {!Bd is the
filtration defined by




where l)1 is the class of L(P) null sets of L(21). The set {Jt : t 2' O} satisfies
the usual conditions (Albeverio et al.(1986) Corollary (4.3.2)).

4. Definition. A stopping time with respect to a filtration {Jt : t E [O.oo)},
is a mapping U: 0 ----> [0,(0) such that {U:::; t} E Jt for all t E [0,(0), with
Joo = L(21).
   A "stopping time with respect to an internal filtration {!Bi : ~E T}, or a !Be
stopping time, is an internal mapping V : 0 ----> TU { 00 } such that {V :::;I} E IFf.
for all ~ E T U {oo}, with !Boo = 21,

  Let
                  !Bv = {A E 21 : An {V = I} E !Bf.,                  vt. E T} ,


5. Definition.
    (i) A stochastic process x : [0, (0) x 0 ----> JRd is a d dimensional local
        martingale with respect to the filtration {Jd, if x is an Jt adapted
        process with sample paths a.e. in D(JRd) and there is a sequence of

            gale with respect to {2.\}, if there is a nondecreasing sequence of IB!.

                and
                                        X (t 1\ Vn) is a     * -   martingale.                         (4)
                 {Vn} is said to reduce X.

6. Definition.     If x is an Jt local martingale and {IB!.: t E T} is an internal
filtration, then a IB!.-local martingale lifting of x is an SDJ lifting X such that
X is an S-local martingale.
      Notation:         For Yi : T x n -----> *lRd (i = 1,2) internal, we write

                                             IYiI(t, w) =   2:: II~Yi(~, w)11                          (5)

and
                                        [YI, Y2]!. =   2:: ~YI (~) . ~Y2(~),                           (6)

where ~Yi(~)             = Yi(~   + ~t) - Yi(~) and· denotes the scalar product.
  Let x : [0, (0) x n --> IRd be a local martingale.   If t > 0 is fixed and
Q = {to,·" ,t1} is a finite subset of [0, t] with 0 = to < ... < tl = t, let
IIQII = SUPi<llti             - ti-Il
                           and St(x,Q)    = 2:~=lllx(t;) - X(ti_I)112.    St(x,Q)
converges in -probability to a limit [x, Xlt as ilQl1 --> 0 and we may choose a
version of [x, xl with sample paths in D. If y also is a local martingale, then

                                              1
                               [x, y] = 2 ([x + y, x + y] - [x, x] - [y, y]).

If X is an internal local martingale lifting of x, [X, X] is an SDJ lifting of
[x, xl and St(x, Q) converges in probability to st([X, X])(t) (Hoover and Perkins
(1983) lemma 6.7 ).
7. Definition.   A process of bounded variation a : [0,(0) x    --> IRd is an             n
Jt-adapted process with a(O) = 0, whose sample paths belong to D and are of
bounded variation on bounded intervals. With lal(t) we denote the variation
of a on [0, t].

8. Definition. Let {SEd be an internal filtration. If a is a process of bounded
variation, a SEt-BV lifting of a is a SEt adapted process A such that A and IAI
(defined by (5)) are SDJ liftings of a and lal respectively.

9. Definition. A d-dimensional semi-martingale z is an Jt-adapted process,
JRd valued, and with sample paths in D, such that z(t) - z(O) = x(t) + a(t),
where x is a local martingale with x(O) = 0 and a is a process of bounded
variation with a(O) = O. A SEt- semi-martingale lifting of (a, x) is a pair (A, X)
such that X is a SEt local martingale lifting of x, A is a SEt- BV lifting of a and
(A, X) is SDJ.

10.     Definition. A predictable rectangle with respect to the filtration
{JdtE[O,oo) is a set of the form (s, t] x Fs, where F; E Js or [0, tj x Fa, where
Fa E Ja. A set is called predictable if it is in the iT-algebra generated by the
predictable rectangles. A process x : [0,(0) x                      n -.
                                                         JR is predictable if it is
measurable with respect to the cr-algebra of predictable sets.

   Suppose M a normed linear space with norm II . II. If x is a local martingale
with x(O) = 0, a is a process of bounded variation, and z = x + a is a semi-
martingale, denote with £(z,M)    the space of functions h : [0,(0) x          M     n -.

For appropiate functions h E £(z, M), z a semi-martingale and appropiate lift-
ings H, Z of hand z , we may define the stochastic integral     h( s )dz( s) as J;

  Notation. If t E * [0,(0), [t] is the greatest el~ment of T satisfying [t] ::; t.

11. Proposition. Suppose {SEt: t E T} is an internal filtration and A
T x    n -.
          *JRd is a' SEt~adapted, SD lifting of a, a bounded variation process

Til is an internal S-dense subset ofT'           = {k~'t : k E 'No}, such that A([~]T" )
is a IEWT,,-BV lifting of a.

     For the proof, see Lemma 7.5 in Hoover and Perkins (1983).

Remark 2. If a = st(A) is continuous, by Proposition 2.5 in Hoover and Perkins
(1983),   AIT"xfl   is S-continuous.

Remark 3. In order to define the Stratonovich stochastic integral we will only
use continuous semi-martingales.    So, if z is a continuous semi-martingale, we
have a canonical representation of z as z = Zo + m + a, where m is a continuous
local semi-martingale with m(O) = 0, a is a continuous process of bounded
variation, and Zo is an ;,vo-measurable random variable.

12. Theorem.       If YI = YI (0) + ml + al and Y2 = Y2(0) + m2 + a2 are contin-
uous semi-martingales     with respect to the filtration ;,vt, there exist an internal
filtration IE~ and S-continuous f}3t-semi-martingale liftings YI and Y2 of YI and
Y2 respecti~ely.
Proof. By Theorem 7.6 in Hoover and Perkins (1983), taking at the same time
(aI, ml) and (a2' m2) it follows the existence of the desired SDJ internal semi-
martingale liftings, by the continuity of the semi-martingales Yl and Y2 it follows
from Remark 2 that YI and Y2 are S-continuous.         0

13. Corollary.       IfYI   and Y2 are continuous     lEt semi-martingales, Yi = Yi(O) +
mi + ai, i = 1,2, then [YI, Y2] = st([MI,        M2]), where MI and M2 are liftings of
ml, and m2 respectively.

Proof. From Theorem 1.2.12 there exist S-continuous semi-martingale liftings
Y; = Y;(O) + M, + Ai of Yi, i = 1,2. We have, for YI (0) = Y2(0) = 0, that


                            [YI, Y2]W   = L ~YI (.~) . ~Y2(~),

   If x and y are continuous semi-martingales,               the Stratonovich       integral is
defined as
                          s, = fat y8x = fat ydx + ~[x, y],

where the right side integral is the Ito integral.
14. Theorem. Let x and y be continuous Jrsemi-martingales.            Then there
exist a {~!} internal filtration and internal semi-martingale liftings X and Y
of x and y, respectively, such that


            s, =   it

Proof. Let (x,y) be continuous Jrsemi·-martingales, with canonical represen-
tation Xt  = x(O) + tri; + forat        Xt
                                       (continuity implies predictability). From
Theorem 12 there exists an internal filtration {~d and an S-continuous semi-
martingale lifting (X, Y) of (x.y).   Let the canonical decomposition of X! be
X,- = X(O) + M;--+ At, where X(O) is an internal random variable ~o measur-
able, M is an internal local-martingale and A is an internal process of bounded
variation. Also assume that X(O), M and A are liftings of x(O), m and a, re-
spectively. Let {Vn} be the internal stopping time reducing X. For §. E * [0,00)
define, for an internal stochastic process H,




with min 0= 00. For 11E T, 11::::::0

   For M*(tw)  = max§.~! IIM(§.,w)1i and V an internal stopping time, we
have, from Lemma 6.3 (b) in Hoover and Perkins (1983), that M*(V)P is S-
integrable if and only if ([M, M]~;e) is.

   By the Optional Sampling Theorem, the S-integrability of M(Vn AnJ implies
the S-integrability of M(R,,), and then we have




so that M*(Rn)     is S-integrable,      which is equivalent to say that ([M, M]R,y/2)
is S-integrable.

  Since [x, x] = st([X, X]) = st([M, M]) we have, from Theorem 3.2.9. in
Albeverio et al (1986) and the above results, that ([x, x])1/2(o Rn) is integrable.
Thus, we obtain




On the other hand,

                                    it   Ily(s)lldlals < 00,

which holds by the continuity of the integrand. Then y E ..c(x, M), the space of
functions of Definition 1.2.10, and from the Remarks 2 and 3, we finally have
that
