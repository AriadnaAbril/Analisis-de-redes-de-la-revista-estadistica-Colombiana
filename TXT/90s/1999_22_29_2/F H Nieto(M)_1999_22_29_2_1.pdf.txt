A comment about estimable functions in linear models with non estimable constraints
ABSTRACT.
In the Searle's (1987) book, Linear Models for Unbalanced Data, a characterization of the estimable functions in linear models with non estimable constraints is presented. In this informal paper, I indicate another characterization of these functions which was developed by Magnus and Neudecker (1988). The aim of the article is to provide a caution signal to linear of linear models theory.
Key words: Estimable functions; Linear models; Non estimable constraints.




1. A controversy

   (te the academic second semester of 1992,1 was teaching a gradúate course
in linear models using Searle's (1987) book. On page 308 of this boolc, I found
the following characterization of the estimable functions in the linear model
with non estimable restrictions:
   liet US assume we have the linear modd

                                     Y = X/?-l-e

with the (conmstent) non estimable coiistraint R0 = r. Then an estimable
function under this model is given by

          q'/3-|-A'(ií/3-r)forA'suchthatA'r = 0; anyA'ifr = 0,                            (1)

2        A COMMENT ABOUT ESTIMABLE FUNCTIONS IN LINEAR ...

where q[0 is an estimable function in the unconstrained model. One deduces
immediately from (1) that, for all A, these estimable functions are the same of
the unconstrained model because of Rp - r = 0.
   At the beginning of 1993,1 saat á lett^ to Profesor Searle in whidí I indi-
cated with all deference a possible problem whit this characterization. Gently,
Prof. Searle answered to me the following argument: the point is right, i.e., one
must delete R0 — t from expression (1) and set only R0 in its place. However,
the dependence of A on r must be múntained.
   I consider that this relationship between A and r can be misuntertood. Fol-
lowing Magnus and Neudecker (1988, pág. 268) (MN), a parametric function
W0 is estimable if, and only iJF, Aí(lV') C M{X' : R'), where in general
M{A) denotes the column space of the matrix A. This fact implies that W0
is estimable if, and only \í, W = WiX -\- Q2R for some matrices Qi and Q2
(compatible for the indicated products). Consequently,

                           W0 = {QiX)0-i-Q2Rl3,

where {QiX)0 is an estimable function in the unconstrained model. In parti-
cular, if W is a row vector, then Qi and Q2 Bxe row vectors, too.
   At this point, one can note that Q2 has not any relationship with r. It
depends only on Qi; at the bottom Une, on W\. This fact is formally supported
by MN's rigorous treatment of the topic.
   Although less critic, we must also prevrait the use of Hoiderson's (1984)
characterization of estimable functions, in the restricted linear modd whit non
estimable constrúnts.

2. An example

   As in Searle's (1987, pág. 244) book, we consider a 1-way-classifícation
experiment with three cells, with the following number of observations per cell:
ni = 2 , n2 = 2, and na = 3. Suppose that the parameter vector is given by
P = {n,01,02)03)' and that we have the constraint /?i -f- /% + /% == 0.
   We can observe that the restriction is not estimable because of

                    ü = (0,1,1,1) 9É QiX for all Qi e R^

where X is the design matrix. We address the question: is /i — (l,0,0,0)j9
an estimable function?. It is easy to see that under the unconstrained model
the answer is no . However, in the restricted model and uáng Magnus and
Neudecker characterization we obtain

              (1,0,0.0) = (1/3,0,0,1/3,0,1/3,0)X -f- (-l/3)ií.

                                     FABIO NIETO                                         3

which means that in this model p is estimable. It is worth noticing that
Q2 = - 1 / 3 does not depend on r = O!. This valué is obtained using only
W = (1,0,0,0),X, and R.
   If we use Searle's characterization, any valué for Q2 can be used because of
r = O, in particular Qj = 0. In this case, we obtain that p is estimable in the
unconstrained model, too. But this is a contradiction.
