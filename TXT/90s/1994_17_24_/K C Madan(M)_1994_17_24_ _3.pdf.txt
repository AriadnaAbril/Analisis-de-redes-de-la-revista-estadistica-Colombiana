ON A VACATION QUEUE WITH TWO PARALLEL SERVERS EACH EQUIPPED WITH A STAND-BY
University of Bahrain
ABSTRACT. The paper studies an M/M/2 queueing system in which each server is equipped with a stand-by. The stand-by are employed only during the vacation períods of main severs. The vacation periods of the two severs are assumed to be independent with an identical exponential distribution. The time dependent results giving probability generating functions for the number in the system under various states have been obtained and in a particular case a known result has been derived at. The corresponding steady state results are also derived.

                                       1.    INTRODUCTION


     Madan [4,5] has studied some queueing systems with server vacations. These va-

cations of the human servers or analogous breakdowns of the mechanical devices are

a common phenomenon and have a definite effect on the efficiency of a system and on

the customer's waiting time in the queue. Among the several important contributions

on this aspect of queues, a few to be mentioned are those by Scboll and Kleinrock [6],

Keilson and Serví [3], Doshi [1], Shanthikumar [7] and Gaver [2]. In all these papers,

the system ceases to work as soon as vacation starts. In this paper, we have intro-

duced the idea of a stand-by which opérales only during the vacation periods of the

main server. The commissioning of a stand-by is common and worthwhile in mamy

real life situations. Briefly, the mathematical model is described by the foliowing

assumptions:


                           2. T H E UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS


      (i) Arrivals occur one by one in a Poisson stream with mean arrival rate A(> 0).

     (ii) There are two parallel servers which provide identical service to the incoming

          units one by one in the order of their arrival. The service times at each channel

          are assumed to be exponential with identical mean service time p~^{p > Q).

     (iii) Both servers are subject to a random cali for vacation. As soon as a server

          Ieaves for vacation, a stand-by takes over and starts operating. And as soon

          as the vacation of a server terminales, it instantly replaces the stand- by and

          inmediately starts providing service.

     (iv) The service times of each stand-by are exponential with identical mean service

          time i/~^.{¡/ < p).

      (v) Let a dt be the first order probability that a server will stop working during

          the interval {t,t -{• dt) and a vacation starts. Further, we assume that the

          vacation periods of a server follow an exponential distribution with mean

          vacation time l/0.{0 > 0). In this case, it foilows that ¿Sdl is the first order

          probability that a vacation will termínate durig the time interval {t,t -\- dt).

     (vi) Commencement or termination of vacations of the two servers are indepen-

          dent of each other also independent of all other stochastic processes involved

          in the system.


                 3,   DEFINITIONS AND TIME - DEPENDENT EQUATIONS


     Let P(j, n, t) denote the probability at time /, j servers (j = 0,1,2) are on vacation

and there are n(> 0) customers in the system (including those being served, if any).

We note that whenever any server is away on vacation, it is imphed that a stand-by

is avíiilable in its place and is providing service if there is a customer in the system.

Clearly, when j servers are away on vacation, 2 — ; servers are available and further,

the availabiUty of a server means it is providing service, if there is any customer in

the system or else, it is idle. Let P{n, t) be the probability that at time t there are

n customers in the system irrespective of the number of server on v2ication so that

P{n,t) = Y,P{j,n,t)

   Initial probability arguments based on the system's underlying assumptions lead

to the foliowing set of forward difference-differential equations for the system :

We assume that initially there are i customers in the system and both servers are

Define the probability generating functions :

Multiplying equations (11) to (19) by suitable powers of z and making use of (20),

we get



(21)     [(s 4- A(l - z) + 2/i -I- 2a)z - 2;Í] P(0, z, s)

             = 2'+^ -f 2/i(r - 1)P(0,0, s) -I- pz{z - 1)P(0,1, s) -t- /?zP(l, 2,s)

Solving equations (21), (22) and (23) simultaneously we obtain

Now, since each of the expressions in (24) contains six unknowns namely, P(j,0,s)

and P{j, l,s), for j = 0,1,2 appearing in their numerator give by equation (25), (26)

and (27), it is sufficient to consider any one of them. Let us consider equation (24)

for j = 0. Il can be shown by Rouche's Theorem that the denominator give by (28)

28                                            K, C, MADAM


has three zeroes inside the circle \z\ = 1, Since P(0,z,s) is regular, the numerator

Noiz, s) must vanish for each of these zeros giving 3 linear equation in 6 unknowns.

Apart from these 3 equation we have 3 other equation namely, (13), (16) and (19)

involving the same 6 unknowns. Thus a total number of 6 equations are sufficient

to determine all the 6 unknowns. Therefore each P ( j , z , s ) , for j = 0,1,2 can be
                                          2
determined and henee P{z,s) = ^ P ( ; , z , » ) , can be completeiy determined.

foregoing results yield


(49)             Ño{z, s) ={ [(s -f- A(l - z) -I- /i -I-1/ -I- 0)z - (/i -t- u)]

                                X [(s + A ( l - z ) - l - 2 t / + 2;3)z-2i']}

                                X {z> + > -^ 2p{z - l)P^o^\s) + pziz - l)Pp^(fi)}

(50)                D(z,s)=[(5-|-A(l-z)-t-2/i)z-2/i]

                                X [(s -I- A(l - z) -I- /i -(- í/ -f- 0)z -{p-^-1/)]

                                X [{s -(- A(l - z) -1- 2t/ -I- 20)z - 2u]


Obviously the two common factors of each of the equations (49) and (50) cancel with

each other so that finally we have


                   P(z,s) =               ^
                                 D{Z,8)                  ^                       ^
                             ^ z'+^ -h 2p{z - 1)P(0,0, s) -I- pz{z - 1)P(0, l,s)
                                          (í-I-A(l - z)-I-2/i)z - 2/1

The result equation (51) agrees with a known result except for notations. {see SAATY

[8], equation 4-105, p 111 }
