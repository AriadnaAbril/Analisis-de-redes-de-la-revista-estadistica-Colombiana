WIENER MEASURE ON Pe (G)
Universidad Nacional de Colombia 
ABSTRACT Nonstandard methods allow a flat integral representation of de Wiener measure on Po(R.). A representation of the Wiener measure on Po(Rd) is given, allowing us to give a nonstandard representation of the Wiener measure on Pe(G) by using Ito map.


    0.    PRELIMINARIES

    For a good introduction of nonstandard analysis we can see (Albeverio, S. (1986)).

The main features t h a t we need in our work are the following.

            We assume       the existence     of   a    set   ' R 2 R- called    the    set   of   the

nonstandard        real    numbers     and     a   mapping * : V ( R ) ^         V^(*R),      (where

V'i ( 5 ) = S,    Ki+i (5) = l/„ (5) U V ( V „ ( 5 ) ) and V (5) = U ^ ^ ^ V n (S)) with three

basic properties. To state the properties we give the following notions.

    An elementary s t a t e m e n t is a statement $ built up from " = ", " € ", relations:

u = V, u G V, the conectives " a n d " , '"or", " n o t " , and " i m p t i e s " , bounded quantifiers

(Vu e t;), (3u G f ) .

    An internal object A is an element of V (*R) such t h a t A = ' S, S £ V ( R ) . A

set in V ( ' R ) which is not internal is called external.

      extended to an internal sequence {Rr, : T] G ' N } such that ñ,, G Hm^m for

       every rj € *N — N.

      extensión is called K-saturated if for every family {A'i}¿gj , card(I) < K, with

       the infinite intersection property, the intersection n,g/A'i is nonempty, i.e. this

       intersection contains some internal object.

       in V'(R). Then, for any Ai, ...,Am Q R and ri, ...,r„ G R,



                                        $(Ai,...,Am,ri,...,r„)



       is true in V (R) if and only if



                                     $(*Ai,...,*A^,*ri           'r„)



       is truein K ( * R ) .

     (•R,* -I- .' • , ' < ) extends R as an ordered field, in general we will omit the * for

the operation and the order relation.

     In R we can distinguish three kinds for numbers:

(a) X € "R is infinitesimíd, if |a;| < r for each r G R"*"-


(b) X G ' R is finite, if there is a real number r G R"*" such that |j;| < r.


(c) X G *R is infinite number, if \x\ > r for each r G R"*"


   Por each finite number x G ' R we can associate a unique real r := st (x) := "x,

such that X = r -\- (, where e is infinitesimal. We say that x is ínfinitely closed to

y, denoted by x « y if and only if x — y is infinitesimal.

   In general we use capital letters H, F, X, etc. for internal functions and processes,

while h, f, X etc. are used for standard ones. For stoppíng times we will always use

capital letters, and specify whether standard or nonstandard is meant.

       For given set A, ' A stands for the elementary extensión of A, and ns ('A) denotes

the nearstandard points in *A. If s is an element in ns{'A), the standard part of s

ís written as st (s), or °s. For given function / , ' / means the elementary extensión

of/.

            We say that the set T is 5-dense if { " t . t e T , "< < 00} = [0,00), and

ns (T) = {í G T : ° t < 00}. With T we denote an internal 5-dense subset of *[0,00).

The elements of T, or more generally, of *[0,oo), are denoted with s, í, u, etc... .

The real numbers in [0,00) are denoted by s, t, u, etc... We will work with different

sets T, so will always specify the definition of such T.

With N we denote the set of nonzero natural numbers {1,2,3,...}, and Ng = Nu{0}.

Elements of No are denoted with n, m, /, etc... while, elements in *N — N will be

denoted with T], N, etc... .

   When we say that F : .4 ^ S ís an internal function, mean that the domain, the

range and the graph of the function are internal concepts.

     1. Definition. A subset .4 C ' R which is internal and for which there exists

N G *N and an internal bijection f : A — {0,1,2                A'^ - 1} is called hyperfinite

set. In such case A ís saíd to have hyperfinite internal cardinalíty N, and we write

1A| = N.

     Hyperfinite sets are to the nonstandard universe what the finite sets are to the

standard one.

     2. P r o p o s i t i o n . Let A and B be hyperfinite sets with internal cardinalities H

and N, respectively. Then:


i) .4 X fi is hyperfinite, with \A x B\ = H N


ii) .4^ = { f : fí — .4 : F is an internal function} is a hyperfinite set ímd its cardi-

       nalíty is H'^.


iii) .4 U S, Af) B are hyperfinite.


iv) If .4 is hyperfinite and G C A is an internal set, also C is hyperfinite.


           Let *R+ =     ' R u { 0 , o o } be the extended   nonnegative hyperreals. An

internal finitely additive measure on the internal algebra U is an internal set function

p :U^       'R.+ , such that


(i) p(4>)=0


(ii) For A , B £ U with Ar\ B = <i>, p{A\J B) = p{A)->r p ( B ) .


     Since p is internal, the finite additivíty extends to hyperfinite unions. Let fi be

a hyperfinite set and let U be the class of all internal subsets of f2. Let us define a

finitely additive measure "/i : ¿/ —> *&+ by °p{A) — "(^(.4)), where "r — oc when

r is an Ínfinitely large element of 'R.|..

   A countable unión of sets can be written as a countable dísjoint unión of sets of the

same kind. As have seen in Corollary A2.8 (Muñoz de Ozak, M. (1995)), a countable

unión of dísjoint internal sets is not internal. Then, "p ís a <T-addítíve measure on

the algebra of internal hyperfinite subsets of íí. The Loeb meeisure ís basicsdly the

extensión v of "p to the (T-algebra generated by U by means of the Carathéodory's

Extensión Theorem.

   3. T h e o r e m (Loeb). The extended real valued function v = L {p) has a stan-

dard <r-additíve extensión to the smallest (externed) «r-algebra M o u Q containíngW.

For each B G M , the valué of this extensión is given by v (B) = InÍA^u.BCA "(J^iA).

This extensión ís unique if p{íl) < -l-oo, in which case, for each B £ M , v{B) =

SUPA6W.B3A "P (^) and there is A G W with v (BAA) = v { ( B - A ) U { A - B)) = 0.

   Por the proof see (Loeb, P. (1975)).

   We say that A ís Loeb measurable if



               Fe. (S) = ^ inf ^ y (A) =          sup    "p (A) = F.„ ( B ) ,
                           A€U,BCA             AeU,B2A


and we denote this common valué by L ( p ) . The collectíon of ídl measurable sets is

denoted with L{íl).

   4. T h e o r e m . (fi, L (Í2), L (p)) is a complete probability space which extends

{Sl,U,p). It is called the Loeb space associated with {íl,U,p).

   Por the proof see A3.2 in the appendlx in (Muñoz de Ozak, M (1995)).

   5.   Theorem.       (Pubini type) Let (íli,Ui,Pi) and (^2,^2,^*2) be hyperfinite

probability spaces and let F : ííi x 02 —' R be a Loeb integrable function. Then:


(i) / (it'i, •) is Loeb integrable for almost all Wi £ Q 1-

(ii) y(u'i) = f f (wi,W2)dL{P2) ís Loeb integrable on ííi.


(iii) ¡ f ( w , , l V 2 ) d L ( P i X P 2 ) = ¡ { ¡ f { W i , W 2 ) d L { P 2 ) ) d L ( P , ) .


     The proof ís due to Keísler. See (Keisler, H.J. (1984)), Theorem 1.14.b)

     1. I N T R O D U C T I O N

     We extend the one dimensional definition of N. Cutland (1990) of the Wiener

measure on Pg (R) to Pg (R"*) . This allows to give a nonstandard definition of Wiener

measure on Lie algebras. Then by means of Ito's map, we obtain the notion of

a nonstandard representation of the Wiener meeisure on Pe(G), where G is a Líe

group.

     2. W I E N E R M E A S U R E ON Pe (G)

     Let

                      Po (R) = {x : [0,1] —*• R I x is continuous and Xo = 0}


and let C the Borel cr-algebra on Pg (R) (Po (R) is given with the uniform convergence

norm). The Wiener measure po over (F© (R) ,C) is a probability measure such that,

for O = ÍO < <i < •• < <n = 1 and a = ( a i , . . . , a „ ) G R",



     PO {Xt, < ai, l < i < n ) =           J l l {2ir (<,+i - <,))-'/'exp L ^ t i _ L ? Í L l ! J dy



where y = ( y i , . . . , yn) G R", yo = O and dy the Lebesgue measure on R". po can be

also described as a probability on (Fo(R) ,C) making the íncrements (Aj,^, — -'^<,)o<,<„_i

independent and A' (0,<,-4.i — ti) distributed. The canonical continuous process given

by Po is a Brownían motion.

     Let r = {0. Ai. 2A<,.. ., 1} be the hyperfinite unit interval. Following Cutland

                          WIENER MEASURE ON Pe (G)                                47


we can make a nonstandard construction of the Brownían motion that gives us an

adequate definition of the Wiener measure on (F© (R) ,C) as follows:

   Fíx an internal probability space {íl,U, P) carrying independent N {0,t) random

variables (f/i),,™- Define a process B : T x Q —y ' R b y



                                     F(0,ti;) = 0

                AB{i,w)= B { i , w ) - B{t_-At,w) = rju        t_eT.


Let P — L ( F ) . Cutland obtains the following result:


(i) For F-a.a. w, B{-,w) is 5-continuous.


(ii) The process 6(-.ií!) = °B{-. w) is a brownían motion.


   Cutland also shows that this construction of 6 gives rise to a construction of the

Wiener measure that can be expressed as follows: Let F be the internal measure on

*R^ induced by B, i.e., for A G I*, where V ís the Borel tr-algebra in *R-'^,


   r(A) = F(5(-,u;)GA)

          = (2.A0-^/^ / n exp ( - ^ ^ ^ S i r ^ ) dX^^dX^^^ • -dX,

with dXt denoting the *Lebesgue mecisure over *R. Writting dX for the *Lebesgue

measure on *R^, and
                              • _ Xt^— A<_¿if _ AAj^
                             '^'-- ' At'       - ^ '

we have

                  r(.4) = (27rAí)"^'-/«p(-i|:.vfA,)..v

and is follows that, with respect to L (f), A' is 5-continuous for almost all A' G ' R ^ ,

and the Wiener measure on (F<, (R) ,C) is given by



                         po{D) = L { r ) { 8 t - ' { D ) ) ,   DeC,



where s t ' ^ (D) = {A' G "R^ : "X G D) .

     Now consider



                Po {R'') = {x : [0,1] ^ R"*! X continuous and Xg = 0}



and denoted with C the Borel «r-algebra on F<, (R**) . The Wiener measure on (Fo (R'') , C )

is defined by



                                tio{xt, e Ai,l < i < n) =




where {t, : 1 < í < n} is a partition of [O, 1], Ai G B (R''), ||a|| is the length of a and

dpi is the Lebesgue measure on R"*.

     Generalizing Cutland's constructions for the Brownían motion, we can construct

d independent B' (•, u') processes such that 6' (•, w) = "B' {•, w). Then



                           ''B{-,w)= {b^{-.w),--,b''{-.w))



is an R"^ valued Brownían motion. Similarlv as for the one dimensional Brownían

motion, we can construct a Wiener measure that can be expressed as follows:

with Xi G ' R ^ . i — l , . . . , d . Applying Theorem 5. (Keísler-Fubini Theorem) we

         PÍ{A) = /io(Ai). • •/io(Ad) = L{r) {st-' (Al)) •••L(T) {st-' (A^))



Since the sets A = Ai x • • • x Aj, with A, G C, i = 1,2, • • •, oí, genérate the Borel

(T-algebra C'', we can extend the definition of PQ to C*.

     Let G be a compact, connected Lie group, and let g be the corresponding Lie

algebra. Let us take an Euclidean metric on g which is Ad{g) invariant. This metric

induces a Riemannian metric on G. Suppose dimG = d. Using and orthonormal

basis,

                 Fo (y) = {x : [0,1] -+ y| x is continuous and Xg = 0}


is isomorphic to Pg (R"^) . let Pe (G) be the set of x : [0,1] —• G which are con-

tinuous , Xo = e and Xt ís invertible with respect to the group operation for all

t G [0,1]. From Wiener's Theorem we can assume the existence of a Wiener meaisure

on (Fe {G),B{Pe (G))), where B{Pe (G)) is the Borel (T-algebra on Fe (G), we want

to give a nonstandard construction of this Wiener measure.

     Following P.Malhavín and M.Malliavin (1990), given x G Po{g) and a partition

S = {tg, ••,<„} of [0,1], we define exp, (x) = 7 as follows:



          7(0) = e

          7(<) = 7(<;-i)exp [[jféifr) (^(<j) -^Cj-i))) '        < e [<;-i,<;]

It is known that when the mesh of 5 tends to zero p'^ a.e., then , the following limit

exists in the metric space Pe (G) :



                                  limexp, (x) = / ( x ) .



The map x — / ( x ) is called the Ito map and is a measurable map.

   Now consider the space ' g ^ . We know that the nearstandard elements of this

space are the 5-continuous functions, and also that with respect to L (r**), A' is 5-

continuous for almost all A' G ' g ^ • With no loss of generality we can assume that

for all X G ' y ^ , A' is 5-continuous.

   For A' G ' g ^ define the internal function V G ' G as follows:


                                          Y (0) = e

                             y(L)-U^-p{\,.-Xi^)

where, t_ — li^ = kSt. ÍG r„ = T. Considering *7 , the elementary extensión of

7, defined above, we see that '7|x = Y; and since ' y is 5-continuous, then Y is 5-

continuous and so Y G *G^. Thus, Y is nearstandard in ' G ^ . Also Y (í) is invertible

for all Í E . T , and we can define a map I : ' y ^ —^ *G^, such that I { X ) — Y.

   From the above nonstandard construction of the Wiener measure on Pg (R"*) and

the R"^ valued Brownían motion, we have that



                       ñ{B{-,w))^e{''B{-,w))^l{h{-,w)),



where Z is the stochastic exponential function defined in Theorem 1.3.8.in (Muñoz de

Ozak, .M. (1995)). Since / is a measurable map. J is a *Borel measurable map. We

52                                       Myriam Muñoz de Ozak


can define an internal measure on (*G^. B ('G^)) by



                                         i/(A) = r < ' ( i   '{A))



for .4 Borel subset of *G^.

     6. T h e o r e m . Por a Borel set B in Pe{G), we can define the Wiener measure

liPAO)(B) as

                                   pp^^G){B)^L{ty){st-'{B)).



proof. For B a Borel set in Fe (G) we have



                         s í - ' (7-1 (B)) = {X G 'y^ : "X G / " ' (F)}

                                              = {AG -y^ : / ( ° A ) G F }


and

                        I " ' (*•<-! (fl)) = r ' {{Y G -G^ : "Y G F})

                                    = {AG - y ^ : < ' r ( A ) G B }

                                     = { A G •y^:/("A)GF}

so that, s í - ' ( / - ' ( F ) ) = í " ' ( s í - ' ( B ) ) . Since /ip,,G)(S) = / í ^ ( / - ' ( F ) ) from the

nonstandard definition oí Pg, we then have



                    /ip.lG, (F) = /xf ( / - ' (S)) = L (F") ( s í - ' ( / - i (F)))

                         = L (r") ( r ' (sí-MB))) = ¿(í^) ( ^ n (F))
