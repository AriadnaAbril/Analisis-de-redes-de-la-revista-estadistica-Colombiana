ON SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION OF THE ARITHMETIC MEAN OF A LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION WITH AND WITHOUT TYPE I
UNIVERSIDAD JAVERIANA
ABSTRACT This article presents several formulas to approximate the required sample size to estimate the arithmetic mean of a lognormal distribution with desired accuracy and confidence under and without the presence of type I censoring to the left. We present tables of exact sample sizes which are based on Land's exact confidence interval of the lognormal mean. Monte Cario estimates of coverage probabilities show the appropriateness of these exact proposed sample sizes at 95% confidence level.
In the case of non censoring, Box-Cox transformations were used to derive formulae for approximating these exact sample sizes and new formulae, adjusting the classic central limit approach, were derived. Each of these formulas as well as other existing formulas (the classical central limit approach and Hewett's formula) were compared to the exact samples size to determine under which conditions they perform optimally and recommendations are given.
KEY WORDS: Confidence interval width, Sample size determination, Box-Cox transformation, L^niformly most accurate unbíased invariant confidence interval, Bias correction. Máximum likelihood estimator.


   1.     INTRODUCTION

   Distributions of concentrations environmental contaminéuits, occupational expo-

sures, small particles, etc., are often approximately lognormally distributed. In the

ccise of environmental exposure measurements, the choice of a suitable s u m m a r y mea-

sure (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, a tolerance limit, etc.) depends on the in-

vestigator's research interest.

   Sampling strategies which focus upon the arithmetic mean (Armstrong 1992;

Evans and Hawkins 1988; Seixas, Robins and Moulton 1988) often are effective for as-

sessing exposure to toxíc materials and is related to the frequency of exposures which

exceed particular air concentrations (Rappaport, Selvín and Roach 1988). Emphasis

and development in exposure monitoring technology have centered on mechanical as-

pects such a how to make sampling more convenient and comprehensíve and how to

make analyses more sensitive and reliable.

   The evaluation of the sample size required to achieve statistically credíble results is

a crucial element in exposure monitoring as well as in a diversity of observatíonal and

experimental studies where the interesting is to estimate the most relevant parameter

of the lognormal distribution.

   For a normally distributed random variable, this mínimum sample size is usually

determined via the use of simple formulas or from tables, Even the more popular

formulas, however, involve large-sample approximations and henee may underestimate

required sample sizes. This underestimation phenomenon could be extreme for certain

sample size formulas based on confidence interval width (Greenland 1988; Kupper and

Hafner 1989).

   In the case of a lognormally distributed random variable, there is very little in

the statistical literature evaluating the minimum required sample size to estimate the

arithmetic mean. Hewett (1995) presented a formula for calculating the approximatf

sample size needed to estímate the true arithmetic mean within a specífied accuracy

and with a specífied level confidence for non censoring data.

   The classical central limit approach has been also used for estimate the minimurr

required sample size for the non censoring case. However, an evaluation of the accu-

racy of these formulas has not been made. This article also presents some guidelines

for the selection of an adequate formula for estimating the exact sample size for the

non censoring case.

   A further probiem arise, for example, when measuring minute concentrations of

environmental pollutants, even state of the art Instruments may not be able to detect

the actual concentration. When concentration cannot be quantifíed below a limit of

detection (LOD), the valué is usually reported as non detectable which leads to left

censoring of the sample and new techniques should address to evalúate the minimum

required seimple size in this type of situations,

   ln the presence of censoring. Cohén (1950,1959) used the method of máximum

likelihood (MLE) to estímate the parameters of normal populatlons from singly and

doubly truncated samples for Type 1 censoring. Saw (1961) noted that above MLEs

were biased and they are not asymptotically unbíased.

   Saw (1961) found the leading term in the bias of the estimators of the mean and

the standard deviation for a normal random variable, suggesting corrected estimators

for singly censored samples. Their bícis increases with increasing degree of censoring.

Thus, in comparison to the estimators without censoring, an adjustment ís required

in a censored sample. The bias tends to zero as the sample size tends to infinity, but

for small sample sizes the bias ís significantly large to warrant consideration.

   This paper includes an attempt to address this need, by proposing exact sample

sizes to provide statistically credíble results for the arithmetic mean of a lognormally

distributed random variable when the data contains values below the limit of detec-

tion and also when this probiem does not exist.

property that it is the same valué as the mean of the normal distribution. Therefore,

required sajnple size formulas and equivalent tables for estimating the geometric mean

are well known. However, there are not straightforward formulae for estimating the

sample size for the arithmetic mean.

   3.1 Classical F o r m u l a

   The classical option to genérate a formula to obtain the required sample size for

a given GSD (estimated from prior information or pilot data) and a desired accu-

racy level (100 TT percentage difference from the true arithmetic mean) is based on

confidence interval width and large sample size theory through the Central Limit The-

orem. Given a confidence level of a and a two-sided confidence interval, we derive

1:9 = Zaf2 i^/y/'^classic) where Udassic represents the required sample size, 9 and

6 were defined above.

   Substituting 9 by (1) and 6 by (2), we derive



        TT (exp {p -t- O.SíT^)) = {Zc,/2/y/^ciassic) v ' e x p (2/i -(- <T2) (exp 0-2 - 1)



Which can be expressed as



                             nc/a„.. = ( 2 a / 2 / T ) ^ ( < ' ' » - l )

An approximate sample size is :



                        rirlassic = ( Z a r J T ^ f ( 6 ' 5 D ' " ^'-^^ - 1) ,                (5)




.\s by expected by the Central Limit Theorem, for most Ccises this formula underes-

timate the required sample size, A discussion of this underestimation is provided in

Section ó.



    3.2 H e w e t t ' s Formula

    Hewett (199Ó) published a sample size formula for estimating the true arithmetic

mean of a lognormal distribution to within a specífied accuracy (± IOOTT percent

difference from the true arithmetic mean) with a specífied level of confidence. This

formula requires also a priori information from previous data or a pilot study. The

approximate sample size can be calcúlate using the foliowing formula



                    riHetLttt - yl/2.n„.i„,-l h i W E J / [ ^ O M V U E J                    (6)



where O ^ V I - E and f>\í\-rE are given in (3) and (4) respectively,            IOOTT represents


the desired accuracy level and í is the valué from a t-student distribution for a 1-a

confidence level and (Op,/oí — 1) degrees of freedom. ^jvíV't/£ • ^MVUE and np,iot are

calculated from prior information or a pilot study.

    l'sing Monte Cario techniques, Hewett (1995) tested this formula by generating

predicted sample sizes for different pilot study sizes, GSD's and several IOOTT per-

centage diñereiices. He used pilot study datasets of sizes ripUo, = -5,10,20 and -50

        ON SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION OF THE ARITHMETIC MEAN ...                           7


from lognormad distributions having a true geometric mean of 10 and true geometric

standard deviations of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4.

   His simulation results indícate that the estimated confidence levéis approached

the target level of 95% for most combinatíons of geometric standard deviations and

npiíot- The exceptions were for large geometric standard deviations (> 3) and small

pilot study sample sizes (< 20). Caution is recommended for estimating the appro-

priate sample size using (6) if ripi/ot is small and the GSD is large.



   3.3 Exact Seunple Size

   Land (1971, 1972, 1974) developed an exact method for constructing one and two

sided confidence intervals for E{X). This method has been described as a special

case of estimating confidence intervals for linear functions of the normal mean and

variance. The exact method is optimal in the sense that it is defined by uniformly

most accurate invariant confidence intervals.

   The mínimum required sample size can be calculated based on the confidence in-

terval width of Land's exact interval, They are expressed as a function of a specífied

GSD and within a desired accuracy level (IOOTT) with a specífied level of confidence.



   Methodology

   Land (1973, 1974, 1975, 1988) published tables of standard limits to calcúlate

the exact confidence intervals. These standard limits are baised on a computationally

tedious method defined in terms of the conditional distribution of a test statistic given

the valué of another statistic. By using these exact confidence intervals. it is possible

to genérate exact sample size tables.

    In this case, it is easy to compute the percent difference between the upper and/or

lower confidence limit and the estimated arithmetic mean. After obtaining these

percentages of variation from the aríthmetíc mean based on GSD, a determination of

which "exact" sample size is necessary can be made.

    Armstrong (1992) published tables of two sided 95% confidence intervals expressed

as a múltiple of the geometric mean for different sample sizes and diíferent GSDs.

Then, using his result and if we assume a geometric standard deviation of 2.5 and we

allow 85.5% variability from the arithmetic mean (upper side percentage difference

between upper confidence limit and the estimated arithmetic mean), the "exact" sam-

ple size will be 20 for any geometric mean, béised in a 95% exact two-sided confidence

level.

    Therefore, independently of the geometric mean, fixed percentage difference from

the true arithmetic mean defines the required sample size. Without loss of generality,

a true geometric mean of one w£is assumed in computations.



    Results

    Dr. Charles E. Land provided the computer program from which estimate confi-

dence intervals for linear functions of the normal mean and variance are calculated.

E.xact confidence intervals for a lognormally distributed random variable can be cal-

culated by taking the exponential of the appropriate confidence interval computed by

Land's program. The program ís written in FORTRAN and has been tested for con-

fidence levéis ranging from 0.900 to 0.995 and the degrees of freedom for estimating

(T^ ranging from 2 to 1000.

    Table 1 contain the minimum required sample sizes for estimating the true arith-

metic mean of a lognormally distributed random variable for the 95% confidence

level. These samples sizes were calculated based on the exact confidence interval

width. Datasets with GSDs of 1.1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 having a true geometric

mean of one for sample sizes of three to 1000 and a confidence level of 95% were

generated by Statistic Analysis System (SAS 1985). The degrees of freedom used for

estimating a"^ were (n-1) (Land 1972). These datasets are used in Land's program

ín order to compute two-sided confidence intervals. Land's program reads these SAS

datasets and outputs ASCII datasets.

   The percentage difference between the limits of the exact confidence intervals and

the true aríthmetíc mean for the conditions given were computed using SAS on the

outputted ASCII dateisets. Because the upper sided percentage is always greater than

the lower sided, the upper sided percentage is the recommended percentage to used

for the estimation of the corresponding sample size, These result appear in the table

as a function of the sample size in term of GDS's and IOOTT percent difference from

the true arithmetic mean.

   In generating the exact sample size values, the percentages of varíation from the

true aríthmetíc mean increase with increasing geometric deviation. This is expected

and implies that the large the variability and lower the percentage of variation from

the true arithmetic mean, the larger the sample size required, or vice versa, the lower

the variability and larger the percentage of variation from the true arithmetic mean,

the lower the sample size required.

     As an example of how this table works, we used the same example mentioned by

Hewett (1995) where a prospective exposure-response study of workers exposed to

weldíng fumes was proposed. For one exposure group from a pilot study, 17 measure-

ments gave an approximately GSD of 1.55, then for a 25% percentage difference from

the arithmetic mean at a 95% confidence level a sample size interpolated from                 ta-

ble I. between GSD=1.5 and GSD=2.0 gives a required sample size of 23 observations

instead of the ló me2isurements suggested by Hewett.

   Other of his examples gave a GSD of 2,16 using 18 measurements within 25%

percentage difference from the arithmetic mean, at a 95 % confidence level, this re-

quires an interpolated sample size of 71 observations instead of the 51 measurements

suggested by Hewett.



   M o n t e Cario Simulations

   Monte Cario simulations were used to the test above results. Artificial datasets

were used to créate different scenarios. The computer clock time at execution was

used to genérate in SAS a seed from the uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. The

seed's integer valué was obtained by multiplying the seed by 1 billíon and rounding

it to the nearest integer roundoff unit. For convenience, this number will be called

a líst's seed. Using this list's seed as a seed to genérate a lognormal variable with

geometric mean given equal to 1 and geometric standard deviation given by exp((r),

with several values, a sample size of size (n) was generated. After taking the natural

logarithm of the data, the sample mean and standard deviation of the normalized

data were computed. This procedure was repeated 1000 times.

   Using Land's program and the sample means and the sample standard deviations,

confidence intervals for the arithmetic mean were calculated. After taking the ex-

ponential function for these confidence intervals, the number of confidence intervals

that contains the true arithmetic mean was counted. This means that the statistic of

interest was the observed confidence level of the 1000 datasets that contains the true

arithmetic mean.

cases shown, this demonstrates that the sample sizes are adequate at the confidence

level specífied.

     Unfortunately, above tables can never be large enough to cover every combination

of GSD and percentage difference from the true arithmetic mean. For this reason, we

are interested in finding a simple closed linear or nonlinear model that corresponds

closely to the exact sample size for estimating the true arithmetic mean of a lognormal

distribution with a specífied level of confidence. Such formulae n = f (GSD, TT) -|- í

   The approach used for the censoring case is to use the meiximum likelihood pro-

cedure to estimate the mean and the variance parameters in the transformed scaJe

under censoring and then to use the properties of the MLE's to back transform the

MLE's to the original scale (Cohén 1959, 1961). The mayor disadvantage of Cohen's

MLE is that when <T is unknown, there are not explicit solutions for the MLE and ít

is necessary to use Newton-Raphson iteration methods.

   To compute the minimum required sample size based on confidence intervals

width, Saw's bias correction to Cohen's máximum likelihood estimator was used.

The MLE is used because of its nice properties and Saw's bias correction factor was

selected because of its low variability ín comparison to the other bias correction ap-

proaches (Custer 1976, Tiku 1978, Schneider 1986) found ín the literature.

   Saw's bias correction factors involves complex computations to obtaín the leading

terms in the bias of p and (r(B{p,p„„) and B{er,p„^)) as a function of fraction of

uncensored observations (p„, = n^/ (n -I- 1)) • "u identífies the number of uncensored

observations. The relationship between the factors p „ , , B(&,pn,) and B ( p , p n , )

respectively, was investígate to obtain a linear regression model that will model this

bias. The final models are shown on equations (10) and (11).



                     B ( p , P n , ) = 0.582896 - 0.547792 (p;]^)                  (10)

These models performed better than the models proposed by Schneider and Weissfel

(1986).

     Methodology

     In like manner as for the non-censoring case, the fixed percentage of variation (TT)

from the true arithmetic mean and the assumed, from prior information, geometric

standard deviation (GSD) must be specífied . In addition, it is also necessary to

specify the proportion of expected censoring (percentile in which Fo = In(LOD) is

located in the population). Then, the same methodology that was used for the non-

censoring case to estimate the minimum required sample size will be used under the

presence of censoring observations.

     For a confidence level of 95%. dataset with GSDs of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3,5 and

4.0 and true arithmetic mean of O were generated by SAS. Under these conditions,

datasets with sample sizes ranging from ten to 1000 were generated with combinatíons

of 10% and 20% censoring.

     Máximum likelihood estimates of a corrected for bias using equation (8) were

used in Land's procedure to compute two-sided confidence intervals. The number

of degrees freedom, used to estimate the máximum likelihood estimator of cr , were

over-estimated to be (HU — 1) using large sample theory through the Central Limit

Theorem (Schmee, Gladstein and Nelson 1982, 1985).

     For each confidence interval, the percentage difference between the upper and

lower confidence limit and the true arithmetic mean was determined. The minimum

sample size, in which the confidence interval coincides with the percentage diff"erence

needed by the researcher is reported in tables 5 for 95 % confidence level for the

GSD coming from pilot data or a priori information, several level of TT and several

proportions of censoring.

   Results

   Similarly as in the non censoring case, the percentage of variation from the true

arithmetic mean increase with increasing geometric standard deviation at any propor-

tion of censoring. This implies that the larger the variability, the lower the percentage

of varíation and the larger the percentage of censoring, the larger the sample size re-

quired.

     From Hewett's examples, if we suppose that for some reason we are expecting a

10 % lower undetectable values of exposure and in the first example we assumed that

the 17 measurement were detectable, then the minimum required sample size for a

25% percentage diff'erence from the arithmetic mean at a 95% confidence level will

approximately be 33 measurements. Let suppose for the second example that a 20 %

censoring is expected. Then, under the same conditions, 96 mesisurements will allow

us to estímate the arithmetic mean within a 25% percentage difference of itself at a

95% confidence level.



     M o n t e Cario Simulations.

     Monte Cario simulations were used to confirm above results. Similar methodology

           ON SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION OF THE ARITHMETIC MEAN ...                        19


was used over different scenarios with the inclusión of the censoring factor and using

bias corrected estimates.

   The computer clock time execution was to genérate in SAS a seed from the uniform

distribution on the interval [0,1]. The seed's integer valué was obtained multiplying

the seed by I million and rounding it to the nearest integer roundoff unit. Again, for

convenience, this number will be called a list's seed, Using this list's seed as a seed to

generated a lognormal variable with geometric mean of 1 and several GSD's a sample

size of size n was generated.

   Expected LOD values of 10% and 20% as a specific levéis of censoring were set,

Any observation below this valué was considered missing and the mean and standard

deviation of the natural logarithms of the sample were calculated. If no censored

observations were found, this sample was excluded and a new sample was generated.

   Cohen's estimators were calculated with help of a macro program and this MLE

estimators were corrected for bias and were used in Land's procedure, This simula-

tion W£is repeated 1000 times and confidence intervals for the arithmetic mean were

calculated,

   \ ñ e r taking the exponential function for these confidence intervals, the number

of confidence intervals that contains the true arithmetic mean was counted, These

result are reported in table 6 for selected sample sizes, specific GSD, specific 100TT%

of accuracy, and specific percentage of censoring for the 95% confidence level. These

results indícate that the estimated confidence levéis were higher for the expected tar-

get level. especialiy for high percentage level of censoring. This means a conservative

approach in the case of sample size determination. These results are shown in

table 6.

     5.COMPARISON OF METHODS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

     Non-censoring case

     Hewett (1995) presents a comparison of sample sizes necessary for estimating

different scenarios . The sample sizes were calculated for various combinatíons of

pilot study sample size (npHot), GSDs, and desired accuracy level (IOOTT). These

results are compared with the exact sample sizes and are show ín table 7.

   Two important results are shown from table 7, First, for small GSD (< 2.0) and

small pilot sample sizes of npUgt = 5,10, Hewett's method closely approximate the

exact sample size. However, for small GSD and large pilot sample sizes, Hewett's

method underestimates the exact sample size required. This is especialiy true as the

accuracy decreases (IOOTT increasing). Secondly, accuracy at high GSD's in Hewett's

22                      ADRIANA PÉREZ AND JOHN J. LEFANTE


formula requires a large number of observations in the pilot study.

     lf a two-stage sampling scheme is considered and the investigator, using Hewett's

formula, collects an initial sample of size UpUot, calculates the minimum required

sample size («//emeíf), but collects only n/fíiüett -^pHot measurements, the assumption

t h a t must first be validated is t h a t the conditions under which the pilot d a t a were

collected are similar to the conditions surrounding the collection of the second stage.

T h e n , the total number of collected measurements required to use Hewett's formula

is always greater t h a n t h a t required by the exact method ( iiHewett + «piíot versus n)

and Hewett's method results in higher sampling costs.

     Comparison between the exact sample size values and the classic formula (5),

using several accuracy levéis (IOOTT) and for several GSD's shows that in general,

the classic formula underestimates the minimum required sample size for estimating

the arithmetic mean of a lognormally distributed random variable for low geometric

s t a n d a r d deviations and several reasonable values of accuracy of IOOTT. T h e level of

underestimation decreases with increasing GSD,

     T h e clcussic formula starts to overestimate the required sample size for large GSD's

( > 3) at large sample sizes, almost independent of the level of accuracy desired. ln the

case of large accuracy levéis, the classic formula always underestimates the required

sample size across GSD's,

     Comparing at the 95% confidence level the exact sample size, the classical sample

size, the proposed model sample sizes and the adjusted classical sample size values,

the foliowing rules apply at this confidence level.

     a) For a GSD of 1.5 and large desired accuracy levéis ( < 25%) the proposed model

from equations (8) is recommended; otherwise for small accuracy levéis ( > 25%), the

        ON SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION OF THE ARITHMETIC MEAN ,..                        23


classical adjusted model (12) (table 4) is preferable,

   b) For médium GSD's (2 and 2,5) and large desired accuracy levéis (< 20%) the

cl2issical adjusted model (13,14) (table 4) ís more reliable than the other approaches;

for small desired accuracy levéis (> 20%) the predicted values from the proposed

model in equation (8) is more adequate.

   c) The classical formula (5) is recommended for the foliowing combinatíons of de-

sired accuracy levéis (100 TT) and GSDs: GSD of 3.0 and IOOTT < 20%, GSD of 3,5 and

IOOTT < 30%, and GSD of 4.0 and IOOTT < 40%. The proposed model from equation

(8) is recommended in estimating the exact sample size required for the foliowing

combinatíons desired accuracy levéis and GSDs: GSD of 3,0 and IOOTT > 20%, GSD

of 3.5 and IOOTT > 30%, and GSD of 4.0 and IOOTT > 40%. Further research should

address the robustness properties of the proposed methodology under non lognormal

sampling conditions.



   Censoring case

   The estimated bias correction factors the máximum likelihood estimates described

by equations (10) and (11) performed well and were used in all computations involving

censored samples. Independently of which method used, bias correction methods are

required and necessarily increase the variance of the máximum likelihood estimates.

   A comparison between the minimum sample sizes required for the non censoring

case and under the presence censoring at different levéis of'censoring and for several

GSDs and several percentage different from the true arithmetic mean was made using

table 1 and table 5. The results shows that a 10% and 20% levéis of censoring will

increase the sample size by at least 15% and 30% respectively with respect to the

24                      ADRIANA PÉREZ AND JOHN J. LEFANTE


non censoring case. This is evídence of the fact that a high degree of censoring

will necessitate a large sample size across any percentage difference from the true

arithmetic mean . As seen in the table, the required sample size at high accuracy

levéis ís much greater than the sample size required at low desired accuracy levéis.

     The results of Monte Cario simulation of 95% confidence intervals shows in table

6 indícate further " fine tuning" of the estimator is possible to more exactly estimate

the confidence intervals. As seen in the table, the results are conservative and will

lead to higher costs.
