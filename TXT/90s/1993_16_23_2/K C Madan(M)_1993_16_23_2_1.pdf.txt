BALKING AND RENEGING IN A VACATION QUEUEING MODEL
University of Bahrain
ABSTRACT
We study a single server queueing system in wchich arrivals follow a compound Poisson process and the service times of customers have exponential distribution. The system is subject to server vacations occurring randomly in time and in addition the impatient customers resort to balking and reneging during the server's vacation period. The steady state probability generating functions for the system when the server is available or on vacation llave been obtained explicitly as also the average number in the system. Various particular cases of interest have also been derived.
Key words: Poisson arrivals, exponential service, steady state, vacation period, balking, reneging, probability generating function, average number in the system. AMS Primary Classifícation: 60 K
INTRODUCTION
Vacation queueing models as well as queveing systems subject to breakdowns
have been studied by many authors including Shanthikumar [10], Manoharan i¿
Krishnamoorthy [9], Madan [8] y Gaver [3], to mention a few. For a complete
overview of such models the reader is referred to Doshi [2]. In the present paper we
have introduced the phenomenon of balking íind reneging in a vacation queveing
model. It can be commonly visualized that some customers may not enter the queue
on finding the system down or the server absent from the system while others, who
have been waiting in the queue may become impatient eind start leaving the system.
For balking and reneging as independent topics, the reader is referred to Haight
[5,6], and Barrer [1].

   (i) Customers arrive at the system in batches of variable size. Let Acj dt (t =
1,2,3,...) denote the first order probabihty that a batch of i customers arrives in
                                                                 00

mean arrival rate of batches and the batches are pre-ordered for service purposes.

    (ii) The system possesses a single server which provides one by service-and the
service times of customers have exponential distribution with mean service time
l//i- (Z^- > 0)
   (iii) The server enters into vacations from time to time and a vacation may
start any time, even while a service is in progress or the server is in the idle state.
The server may be deemed to be analogous to a mechanical service channel which
is subject to failures occurring randomly in time. The customer whose service is
suspended remains at the head of the queue without affecting the total number
in the system. The server's period of availability is exponentially distributed with
mean lenght \ / a (a > 0). In other works a A/ is the first order probability that
the server will cease to work (i.e. the vacation period will begin) during the time
interval (<,< + A¿).

   (iv) The lenght of the vacation period follows an exponential distribution with
mean lenght 1//? {0 > 0). In other words, /? A< is the first order probability that a
vaication will termínate (i.e. the server will join the system) during the time interval
( t J + At).
   (v) During the server's vacation not all batches of customers who arrive at the
system will join the queue. It has been assumed that an arriving batch joins the
queue with probability ir and balks (leaves as soon it arrives) with probability 1 — n.
   (vi) In addition to balking there is reneging (one by one) during the server's
vacation period. It has been íissumed that r At is the first order probability that
a customer will renege in the time interval {t,t -\- Ai) during the server's vacation
period.
   (vii) Various stochastic processes involved in the system are independent of each
other.


EQUATIONS GOVERNING THE SYSTEM.
    We define

         a„(í) = the probability that at time t there are n ( > 0) customers in the
         system, including one in service, if any and the server is available (i.e.
         providing service if there is at least one customer of idle if there is none).

         Vn{t) = the probability that at time t there are n ( > 0) customers in the
         system and the server is on vacation.

         p„(<) = a„(í) -I- Vn(t) is the probability that at time t there are n (> 0)
         customers in the system irrespective of whether the server is available or
         on vacation.

In order to study the steady state behavior of system, we drop the argument t in
the above definitions of probabilities and directly have the foUowing set of steady

We define the following probabihty generating functions:

   We multiply equation (1) by z"+^, sum over n from 1 to oo, and z times equation
(2), use (5) and simplify. Thus we have

(6)          {-Xz c{z) -I- (A -f- /< -i- a)z - n}a{z) = n{z - l)ao -t- 02 v(z)

Similarly, we multiply equation (3) by z""*"^, sum over n from 1 to oo add z times
equations (4), use (5) and simplify. Then we have

(7)         {-XTTZ C{Z) -\-{XTr + r-\- 0)z - r)v{z) = r{z - l)t;o -I- az a{z)

Solving equations (6) and (7) simultaneously for a{z) and v{z), we have

Now to determine the only unknowns QQ and VQ appearing in the numerators of
the right hand sides of equations (8) and (9), we proceed as follows. We note from
(5) that c{l) = 1 and, for that matter, (10) yields ibi(l) = a, ¿2(1) = 0 and,
therefore, the denominators of both a{z) and t;(z) in (8) and (9) become O at z = 1
and, therefore, a{z) and t;(z) are indeterminate of ^ form. We will, therefore use

L'Hospital's rule on (8) and (9), using the above valúes, simplifying and taking the
limit as z —+ 1, we have

Using (11) and (12), the normalizing condition a(l) -f v{l) = 1 yields,
                                                  00                       00

Now, in view of the fact that in the steady state the overall utihzation of the M/M/1
system is ^, it follows that the probability that there is no customer in the system
irrespective of whether the server is available or not is given by

(14)                                   ao-\- VQ = I
                                                             Ii

From (13) and (14), we have, on simplifying
                                                    00                         00
                    ifi - X){a + 0) + a(A^ ^ i a - r) + 0{X E ic. - Ii)

"^'          "» =                          W^rn^)                          '^
This is the probability that the system is empty i.e. there is no customer and also
the server is not available.
   From (14) and (15), we then have

                        /?^2 ^ r{Xa + X 0 -         ^0) - /¿(TTQ + 0)X £               ¿c,-
                                                                                1= 1
(16)             ao =
                                          P(a+ /?)(/'-O
This is the probabihty that there is no customer in the system although the server
is available but idle.
    Having thus determined VQ and OQ, we can substitute their valúes given by (15)
and (16) in (8) and (9) to enable us to completely and exphcitly determine a(z)
and v{z) from which one can determine Vn and a^ for n > 1 either by expanding (if

be easily verified that p{z) in (48) is indeterminate of the form § at z = 1, since
