Abstract
Determining the extent of a disparity, if any, between groups of people, for example, race or gender, is of interest in many elds, including public health for medical treatment and prevention of disease or in discrimination cases concerning equal pay to estimate the pay disparities between minority and majority employees. The Peters-Belson (PB) regression is a form of statistical matching, akin in spirit to Bhattacharya's bandwidth matching which is proposed for this purpose. In this paper, we review the use of PB regression in legal cases from Bura, Gastwirth & Hikawa (2012). Parametric and nonparametric approaches to PB regression are described and we show that in nonparametric PB regression a suitable kernel function can improve results, i.e. by selecting the appropriate kernel function, we can reduce bias and variance of estimators, also increase the power of tests.
Key words Kernel function; Local linear regression; Welch's approximation.
Resumen
Determinar el alcance de una disparidad, si la hubiere, entre grupos de personas, por ejemplo, raza o g√©nero, es de inter√©s en muchos campos, incluida la salud p√∫blica para el tratamiento m√©dico y la prevenci√≥n de enfermedades o en casos de discriminaci√≥n en relaci√≥n con la igualdad salarial para estimar las disparidades salariales entre los empleados minoritarios y mayoritarios. La regresi√≥n de Peters Belson (PB) es una forma de coincidencia estad√≠stica, similar en esp√≠ritu a la coincidencia de ancho de banda de Bhattacharya que se propone para este prop√≥sito. En este trabajo, repasamos el uso de la regresi√≥n del PB en casos legales de Bura et al. (2012). Se describen los enfoques param√©tricos y no param√©tricos de la regresi√≥n del PB y demostramos que en la regresi√≥n no param√©trica del PB una funci√≥n de kernel adecuada puede mejorar los resultados, es decir, seleccionando la funci√≥n de kernel apropiada, podemos reducir el sesgo y la varianza de los estimadores, tambi√©n aumentan el poder de las pruebas.

1. Introduction

      In disparate treatment and equal pay discrimination cases, the salaries of mi-
nority/disadvantaged group (DG) members should be compared to those of sim-
ilarly qualied majority/advantaged group (AG) employees. The PB regression,
as well as ordinary regression with an indicator representing group status, have
been accepted by courts (Gray 1993).          As Bura et al. (2012) point out the PB
method oers some advantages compared to standard regression with a dummy
or indicator variable.        First, the method is intuitive and comparatively easy to
understand for a general audience (e.g., judges, juries, etc.). For example, in the
context of sex discrimination cases, PB regression estimates the salary equation
for the male group (AG) incorporating related covariates and then takes the dier-
ence between the female group's (DG) actual salary and the estimated salary that
the DG employee would have received if s/he were paid according to the equation
for AG employees.        Moreover, the estimated pay dierential obtained from the
PB approach is individualized for each member of the protected group. In con-
trast, ordinary least squares linear regression with an indicator variable estimates
a common overall eect of being DG, after adjusting for the relevant covariates.
This approach assumes that any dierential is the same across the entire range of
covariate values. Another advantage of the PB method is that the females whose
salaries are higher than predicted and were not discriminated against are readily
identiable.

      The PB regression method was rst introduced by Peters (1941) and Belson
(1956) for conducting treatment-control comparisons that accounted for relevant
covariates by creating statistical matches for the treatment group observations.
Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973) used this idea to decompose the dierence be-
tween the means of the two groups into components.             Gastwirth & Greenhouse
(1995) applied the PB method to salary data as well as to logistic regression for
binary responses in order to analyze the data arising from a case involving promo-
tion decisions (     Capaci v. Katz and Bestho1 ). Furthermore, Nayak & Gastwirth
(1997) extended the method to generalized linear models. Hikawa, Bura & Gast-
                 a
wirth (2010 ) introduced nonparametric PB in regressions with a binary response
as an alternative to logistic regression. Hikawa, Bura & Gastwirth (2010 ) intro- b
duced the local linear regression in PB. They considered the unknown functions
for modeling the mean response in the two groups.              Then they used Epanech-
nikov kernel to estimate unknown functions (for details about linear and nonlinear
regression see Achcar & Lopes, 2016).

Kernel Function in Local Linear PB Regression                                           237



     In this paper, we review the use of PB regression in legal cases from Bura
et al. (2012). We suggest using another kernel functions and show that choose an
appropriate kernel function can improve the results. The layout of the paper is as
follows: In Section 2, we review parametric PB regression, based on parametric
ordinary linear regression. Section 3, introduces a recent nonparametric version
                              b
from Hikawa et al. (2010 ) that increases the applicability of the PB approach. In
Section 4, we apply all of the methods outlined to data from a sex discrimination
case, and Section 5 contains the simulation study. We present the conclusion in
Section 6.




2. Parametric Peters-Belson Regression

     In this section, we review parametric PB regression. Like the study of Bura
et al. (2012), we assume that the salaries (Y ) are determined by a set of covari-
ates (e.g., seniority, education, etc.) plus normally distributed random errors (Œµ).
Suppose the salaries for minority and majority employees are given, respectively,
by

                                              T
                M inority(DG) :        Y1i = X1i Œ≤1 + Œµ1i ,   i = 1, . . . , n1
                                              T
                M ajority(AG) :        Y2j = X2j Œ≤2 + Œµ2j ,   j = 1, . . . , n2
X denotes the covariate vector and Œ≤ the corresponding coecient vector. The
errors, in each equation, are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero
                2         2
and variance œÉ1 and œÉ2 , respectively.        If Œ≤1   = Œ≤2 , there is no unjustiable pay
dierential and the dierence of salaries is due to random variability. A meaningful
measure of pay dierential against the minority employee with a given value of the
covariate is:

                                        T        T
                                  Œ¥i = X1i Œ≤1 ‚àí X1i Œ≤2
If Œ¥i is negative, the i-th minority employee is underpaid compared to a major-
ity employee with the same covariate values. In parametric PB, a linear regres-
sion model is tted to the data for the majority employees. Then each minority
                                         T
member's salary is predicted by X1i Œ≤ÃÇ2 , where X1i is the covariate vector for the
i-th minority member and Œ≤ÃÇ2 is the least squares estimate of Œ≤2 . The dierence,
              T
Di = Y1i ‚àí X1i  Œ≤ÃÇ2 , between the actual and predicted salaries is the estimate of the
pay dierential of the i-th minority employee relative to a similarly qualied ma-
jority employee. Thus, Di is the parametric PB estimate of Œ¥i . When the model
is correct, Di is unbiased for Œ¥i and the corresponding unbiased estimator for the
average disparity overall minority employees

where XÃÑ1 is the mean vector of the minority covariate values. The variance of DÃÑ
is

                                           œÉ12
                              V ar(DÃÑ) =       + œÉ22 XÃÑ1T (X2T X2 )‚àí1 XÃÑ1 ,                     (1)

where  X2 = (X21 , X22 , . . . , X2n2 )T is the usual design matrix of the majority
                             2      2     2
group. When we assume œÉ1 = œÉ2 = œÉ , the test statistic


                                               DÃÑ

                                  œÉÃÇ [1/n1 + XÃÑ1T (X2T X2 )‚àí1 XÃÑ1 ]
                                    2


can be used to test the null hypothesis Œ¥ = 0. Gastwirth (1989) suggested that
                                                                                 2
majority observations be used to estimate the common variance œÉ                      because under
the hypothesis of no discrimination both majority and minority are supposed to be
paid under the same system and hence the variances are supposed to be the same
                          2
as well. If we use œÉÃÇ   = œÉÃÇ22 , under the null hypothesis of Œ¥ = 0, the test statistic
in (2) is t-distributed with n2 ‚àí p2 degrees of freedom, where p2 is the number of
parameters (coecients) in the majority model.

      Gastwirth (1989) discusses the form of the variance of DÃÑ in simple regression
and the hypothesis testing for Œ¥ . Nayak & Gastwirth (1997) focus on a slightly
dierent version of Œ¥ and its estimator and derive its distributional properties.

      When the error variances are assumed to be dierent, we can approximate the
distribution of the test statistic by using Welch's approximation approach (Welch
(1949); Schee (1970); Nayak & Gastwirth (1997)).                    Under this approximation,
the test statistic distribution under the null is approximated by a t distribution
with degrees of freedom:

                                    2                              2
                                     œÉ1     T   T      ‚àí1
                                     n1 + XÃÑ1 (X2 X2 )    XÃÑ1 œÉ22
     df =                                                                                       (3)
             œÉ14 /[n21 (n1 ‚àí p1 )] + œÉ24 /(n2 ‚àí p2 )XÃÑ1T (X2T X2 )‚àí1 XÃÑ1 XÃÑ1T (X2T X2 )‚àí1 XÃÑ1

         2         2
Since œÉ1 and œÉ2 are unknown, the degrees of freedom are estimated by substituting
œÉÃÇ12 and œÉÃÇ22 in (3). For more details see Hikawa (2009).
Note 1.       The measure of average pay dierential Œ¥ was used by Gastwirth (1989)
with the particular intention to analyze the data arising from pay discrimination
cases where the two underlying mean salary lines do not cross each other in the
range of covariate values that are of interest. When the two mean lines cross each
other, some values of Œ¥i become negative and others become positive; as a result,
taking the average will cancel out these negative and positive values and d will
no longer be a meaningful measure of pay dierential.                    Therefore,   Œ¥ should be
used only for the cases where the two mean lines do not cross.                    While this is a
theoretical possibility, but this situation does not happen in practice. Therefore,
we recommend that the regression lines be plotted and if they cross, try to nd
out why; perhaps a variable has been omitted. After considering all the necessary
variables, we probably can be run the PB method.

Kernel Function in Local Linear PB Regression                                          239



3.     Local Linear Peters-Belson Regression

     In this section, we review the local linear regression technique to estimate the
expected minority responses from the majority data in the PB approach (Bura
et al. 2012). Then, we express the role of the kernel function in tting the local
linear regression model.

                          b
     Hikawa et al. (2010 ) mentioned two problems an analyst of pay discrimina-
tion data often encounters.       The rst is the diculty in estimating the salary
equation when it does not appear to follow any usual parametric forms (e.g., lin-
ear, quadratic).    The second problem pertains to determining who the relevant
male/majority employees are to be compared against female/minority employees
of interest. Including too many irrelevant majority employees in the comparisons
(e.g., male employees who are too senior compared to the target female employees)
may introduce serious bias in the estimated disparity (Greiner 2008).

                                                            b
     To address these problems, Hikawa et al. (2010 ) introduced the local linear
regression in PB. Local linear regression ts a linear regression in the neighborhood
of the covariate values of each minority member. The method is well suited for
equal pay cases since the estimation/prediction of the salary of a minority employee
is based on majority employees whose qualications are closest to those of the
minority employee and thus should receive the greatest weight. Furthermore, the
similarity of this method to matched-pairs is expected to make the results more
understandable to judges and juries.        Local linear regression is similar in spirit
to bandwidth matching introduced by Bhattacharya (1989). However, the weight
given to each majority observation decreases with the distance of the covariate
values from the target minority member.

     Like the study of Bura et al. (2012), suppose we have d covariates and the data
consist of n1 minority observations, (X11 , Y11 ), . . . , (X1n1 , Y1n1 ), and n2 majority
observations, (X21 , Y21 ), . . . , (X2n2 , Y2n2 ), where X is a vector of d xed covariate
values. The response values of minority and majority members are generated by
the following equations:

                   M inority :   Y1i = m1 (X1i ) + Œµ1i ,    i = 1, . . . , n1
                   M ajority : Y2j = m2 (X2j ) + Œµ2j ,      j = 1, . . . , n2
where m1 (X1i ) = E(Y1 |X = X1i ) and m2 (X2j ) = E(Y2 |X = X2j ). Also Œµ1i 's and
Œµ2j 's are iid N (0, œÉ12 ) and N (0, œÉ22 ), respectively. The only assumption we make
on the unknown functions modeling the mean response in the two groups, m1 (X)
and m2 (X), is that they are twice dierentiable.

     As in the parametric PB denition of disparity, the pay disparity for the i-th
minority member is

                              Œ¥i = m1 (X1i ) ‚àí m2 (X1i ),
and the average disparity of all minority members is

                                  n1
                              1 X
                         Œ¥=          [m1 (X1i ) ‚àí m2 (X1i )].

separately estimating m1 (Xi ) for i = 1, . . . , n1 and m2 (Xj ) for j = 1, . . . , n2 ). The
test statistic for testing for lack of disparity (H0 : Œ¥ = 0 vs. H1 : Œ¥ 6= 0) is dened
to be
                                         DÃÑLOC
                                    t= p            .                                      (4)

When the two variances are equal (i.e., œÉ1 = œÉ2 = œÉ ), we estimate the common
                                                        2
variance by the majority variance estimate œÉÃÇ               = œÉÃÇ22 ; see Gastwirth (1989). The
estimated variance of DÃÑLOC becomes
                               Ô£´                                  Ô£∂

Therefore, under the assumption of equal variances, the test statistic for group
                                    Œ∑2
disparity is t distributed with
                                    Œ∫ degrees of freedom, where Œ∑ = Œ∑2 and Œ∫ = Œ∫2 .
   When the two variances are assumed to be dierent, as in parametric PB, we
can apply Welch's approximation approach to nd the approximate distribution
of the test statistic. The expression of the variance of DÃÑLOC can be expressed as

                                         Ô£´                              Ô£∂

                                                      n1 X   n2

             var(DÃÑLOC )   =        + 2          S2 +           Sij Slj Ô£∏
                                n1   n1 i=1 j=1 ij          j=1            i6=l

                           =    œÉ12 C1 + œÉ22 C2 .

When H0 is true, the test statistic (4) is approximately t distributed with the
degrees of freedom
                                          (œÉ12 C1 + œÉ22 C2 )2
                             df =                                     .                    (5)

         2        2
Since œÉ1 and œÉ2 are unknown in most practical situations, the degrees of freedom
                                      2         2
are approximated by plugging œÉÃÇ1 and œÉÃÇ2 into (5).

   The nearest neighbor bandwidth that xes the fraction of data that contribute

kernel as the weight function, but we recommend to use another kernels.                   The
kernel function W (u) is a non-negative real-valued integrable function satisfying
the following requirements:


  (i) W (u) ‚â• 0 for all u;
      R‚àû
 (ii)
       ‚àí‚àû
          W (u)du = 1;

(iii)   W (.) is symmetric about zero;

   In Table 1 some samples of kernels are given. In these kernels, u = ||X2j ‚àí
X1i ||/h and h is the bandwidth. Epanechnikov kernel is the optimal kernel in the
sense that roughly both the asymptotic mean squared error and the mean inte-
grated squared error are minimized (Fan & Gijbels 1996). Loader (1999) suggests
scaling the vector norm.

Since X1ki is xed, Sk is simply the sample standard deviation of X2k about X1ki
for the majority members for the k -th covariate.

      But using Epanechnikov kernel cannot be optimized, since in Epanechnikov
kernel if |u| ‚â§ 1 then W (u) = 0, while in practice, there may be some values of |u|
that exceed from 1 and thus this kernel doesn't have correctly results to estimate
of these values. Therefore, we recommend using the kernel functions that values
of u belong to real numbers. We used Normal kernel, Logistic kernel, and Laplace
kernel and we concluded these kernels reduce bias and variance of estimators and
increase the power of the test. In this paper, we will call these real kernels.

   Since the sample sizes of 16 males and 15 female are too small to t a local
linear regression model, we augmented the data set following the method used by
Bhattacharya (1989) and Bhattacharya & Gastwirth (1999), where they analyze
data from   Berger v. Iron Workers Local 201.               Fitting a Gamma distribution
to the seniority data yielded Gamma(4, 20) for males and Gamma(2, 33) for
females. Then, we consider two scenarios for enhancing observations. The rst,
we generate additional salary data for 34 males and 35 females according to the
tted models in (6) and (7) and other, we generate additional salary data for 84
males and 85 females according to the tted models in (6) and (7).                Therefore,
in two scenarios sample sizes of male and female are same and equal to 50 and

100, respectively. The error variances were set equal to œÉÃÇm = 7494.5 and œÉÃÇf   =
8757.1 in order to match the estimated variances of the error terms from the tted
regression models. The data were simulated based on unequal variances for males
and females. Consequently, we compute the variance of DÃÑ based on the assumption
of unequal variances and approximate the degrees of freedom of the test statistics
using the Welch's approximation approach. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results
from applying the ve methods: (1) Parametric PB, (2) Local Linear PB with
Epanechnikov kernel, (3) Local Linear PB with Normal kernel, (4) Local Linear
PB with Logistic kernel and (5) Local Linear PB with Laplace kernel.

      In Tables 4 and 5, the negative values of DÃÑ indicate that female employees were
underpaid on average compared to their similarly qualied male counterparts. The
bias and standard error of the average pay dierential estimated. In Table 4, value
of DÃÑ of the local linear PB with Epanechnikov kernel is dierent with other meth-
ods and its variance is greater than the other local linear methods. However, the
parametric PB has the minimum variance. In Table 5, the results of methods are
similar, but parametric PB still has the least variance and among nonparametric
methods, the real kernels have fewer variances. These results demonstrate using
the appropriate kernel can be eective in reducing bias and standard error. How-
ever, from a single example, one cannot make general conclusions. Therefore, we
conducted a further simulation study, discussed in the next section.

      Since the estimated amount of pay dierential from all the methods is quite
large, the p-values of all test statistics are very small. Hence, all methods would
reject the null hypothesis of no pay dierential and conrm the court's conclu-
sion that the female employees were discriminated in their pay with an average
dierential about $129-134 ($122-125) per pay period for sample size 50 (100).

Kernel Function in Local Linear PB Regression                                         245



5. Simulation

   In this section, we display the role of kernel functions in local linear PB regres-
sion by using simulated data. It should be noted that the simulation models were
chosen from Bura et al. (2012). Consider a company that has three stores with
employees of both sexes. In the rst, amount of pay is same for two group (male
and female). The data of this store simulated from equation (8).


                                yi = 20000 + 200xi + Œµi .                             (8)


In the stores 2 and 3, amount of pay are dierent for two group and women are
underpaid relative to comparable men in both stores but the system leading to
the disparity dier in the two stores. In the second store, men and women start
at the same salary but men receive better raises over time, while in the third store
men start at a slightly higher salary and also receive higher raises over time. The
data of these two stores simulated from equations (9) and (10), respectively.
                         (
                             20000 + 200xi + Œµ1i   when i is female
                  yi =                                                                (9)
                             20000 + 250xi + Œµ2i   when i is male.

                         (
                             20000 + 200xi + Œµ1i   when i is female
                  yi =                                                               (10)
                             20500 + 250xi + Œµ2i   when i is male.

The values of the seniority predictor variable for females and males were generated
from the Gamma distribution with scale parameters 3 and 2 for females and males,
respectively, and shape 2 for both sexes. To sum up, the simulations run according
to 3 choices for sample sizes of two groups. The rst, we choose in all three stores,
the number of males is 40 and the number of females is 30, in the second choice,
we consider the number of males is 80 and the number of females is 60 and the
last scenario is based on 60 males and 80 females. The error variances were the
same and errors generated from the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
error 300. Ten thousand replicates were used in the simulation and the signicant
level of Œ± = 0.05 considered.

   Table 6 reports the results of the rst choice for sample sizes.          In the rst
store, where amount of pay is equal for two group, by using parametric PB the
null hypothesis Œ¥ = 0 is rejected 5.75% of the times, But by using local PB with
Epanechnikov kernel the null hypothesis is rejected 5.96% of the times and by real
kernels Normal, Logistic and Laplace the null hypothesis is rejected 5.35%, 5.28%
and 5.34% of the times, respectively.      Therefore, the size of all tests is close to
nominal level 5%. In store 2, by using parametric PB the null hypothesis Œ¥ = 0
is rejected 95.22% of the times, But by using local PB with Epanechnikov kernel
the null hypothesis is rejected 81.97% of the times and by real kernels Normal,
Logistic and Laplace the null hypothesis is rejected 86.40%, 93.47% and 93.09% of
the times, respectively. The comparison of the power of the local linear tests shows
that tests based on Logistic and Laplace kernels have the high powers followed by
the Normal kernel, and Epanechnikov kernel, respectively.          In store 3, by using
parametric PB the null hypothesis Œ¥ = 0 is rejected 100% of the times, But by

using local PB with Epanechnikov kernel the null hypothesis is rejected 98.46%
of the times and by real kernels Normal, Logistic and Laplace the null hypothesis
is rejected 99.25%, 100% and 100% of the times, respectively. The comparison of
the power of tests show that all tests have good powers. Furthermore, in all three
stores, the standard error of local PB with Epanechnikov kernel is more than other
methods.

      Tables 7 and 8 show the results of two other choices for sample sizes.          The
ndings of these two tables are similar to the previous table. The size of all tests
is close to nominal level 5%, and tests based on real kernels have the good powers.
Also, using local PB with Epanechnikov kernel causes the bias and larger standard
error.

6. Conclusion

   In this paper, we show that by selecting an appropriate kernel, we can use local
linear PB regression and the results of this method are similar to the parametric
method. Therefore in most cases, due to the constraints of parametric PB regres-
sion, we can be used local linear PB regression. According to the results of data
from   EEOC v. Shelby County Government and simulation study we concluded
that the use of local linear PB regression be eective in determining the extent of
a disparity between groups and in local PB method using real kernels can reduce
the bias and variance of the estimators and also increase the power of the test. By
comparing the three real kernel functions we deduced Logistic and Laplace kernels
have better results. By using these kernels the bias is the lowest and variance of
the estimator is relatively small.     Moreover, the power of the test is acceptable.
But, the Normal kernel compared to two other real kernels has weaker results.
However, all three real kernel in comparison with the Epanechnikov kernel have
better performances. It should be noted that we investigate the performance of
some other kernels like Triangular and Cosine and have concluded that results of
these kernels are similar to the Epanechnikov kernel. Therefore, we recommend
using real kernels in local linear PB regression.
