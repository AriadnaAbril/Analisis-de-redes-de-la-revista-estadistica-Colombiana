Abstract
The weighted distributions are used when the sampling mechanism records observations according to a nonnegative weight function. Sometimes the form of the weighted distribution is the same as the original distribution except possibly for a change in the parameters that is called the form-invariant weighted distribution. In this paper, by identifying a general class of weight functions, we introduce an extended class of form-invariant weighted distributions belonging to the non-regular exponential family which included two common families of distribution: exponential family and non-regular family as special cases. Some properties of this class of distributions such as the sucient and minimal sucient statistics, maximum likelihood estimation and the Fisher information matrix are studied.

Resumen
Las distribuciones ponderadas son usadas cuando el mecanismo de muestreo registra observaciones de acuerdo a una función no negativa. En ocasiones la forma de la función ponderada es igual a la original, excepto, posiblemente, en un cambio de parámetros y se denominan distribuciones ponderadas de forma invariante. En este artículo identicamos una clase general de funciones ponderadas e introducimos una forma extendida de distribuciones ponderadas de forma invariante, la cual incluye dos familias comunes: la familia exponencial y la familia no regular como caso particular. Algunas propiedades de estas distribuciones como las estadísticas sucientes y máximas sucientes, la estimación de máxima verosimilitud y la matriz de información de Fisher son estudiadas.
Palabras clave Distribución ponderada; estimación de máxima verosimilitud; familia exponencial no regular; invarianza de forma; matriz de información de Fisher.

1. Introduction

    The weighted distributions have been used when the sampling mechanism
records observations according to a certain chance. For example, suppose that
the random variable X has the probability density function (pdf) f (x; θ) with pa-
rameter θ ∈ Θ and that the probability of the recording observation x of X be
proportional to a non-negative weight function       β) where β is a known or
                                               w(x, θ,
unknown parameter, and that assumed E w(X, θ, β) exists. Then the recorded
                                          

x is an observation of X w , having a pdf
                                           w(x, θ, β)f (x; θ)
                         f w (x; θ, β) =                   .                     (1)
                                            E w(X, θ, β)

The weighted distributions are widely applied in various studies such as line tran-
sect sampling, renewal theory, branching process, bio-medicine, statistical ecology
and reliability modeling. Some references are Patil & Rao (1978); Rao (1958);
Gupta & Kirmani (1990); Oluyede & George (2002) and Gupta & Keating (1986).
    An important property of weighted distributions is that the original distribu-
tion keeps the same form under weighting except possibly for a change in the pa-
rameters. This is known as the form-invariant property of weighted distributions.
According to Patil & Ord (1976), the distribution of X is said to be form-invariant
under the weight function w(x, θ) when

                                f w (x; θ) = f (x; η),                             (2)

where η = η(θ) ∈ Θ. The form-invariance is a useful property for the weighted dis-
tributions because the estimate of the population parameters based on a random
variable could be used in weighted cases, with considerable modication (Nair &
Sunoj (2003)). Patil & Ord (1976) proved that a necessary and sucient condi-
tion for X to be form-invariant under size-biased weight function of order β (i.e.
w(x, β) = xβ ) is that its distribution belongs to log-exponential family with pdf

                       f (x; θ) = exp{θ log x + a(x) − c(θ)}.

Sankaran & Nair (1993) and Sindu (2002), respectively, derived the conditions
which the Pearson and generalized Pearson families of distributions are form-
invariant under w(x) = x. Alavi & Chinipardaz (2009) developed the Patil &
Ord (1976) results and gave the necessary and sucient conditions for the form-
invariance of the distributions belong to exponential family with pdf

                     f (x; θ) = exp{θ log ν(x) + a(x) − c(θ)},                     (3)

under the general weight function w(x, β) = [ν(x)]h(β) . Esparza (2013) proved
that two discrete distribution phase-type and matrix-geometric distributions are
form-invariant under the size-biased factorial sampling of order β (i.e. w(x, β) =
x(β) = x(x − 1) · · · (x − β + 1)).
    There are the distributions that their pdf form can be written as the func-
tion form of (3) and also are form-invariant under the weight function w(x, β) =

[ν(x)]h(β) but do not belong to the exponential family. For example, consider the
exponential distribution with two unknown parameters of α and θ and the pdf

              f (x; α, θ) = exp{θ log ν ∗ (x) + a∗ (x) − c∗ (θ)} I(α,∞) (x),

where ν ∗ (x) = e−x , a∗ (x) = 0 and c∗ (θ) = −(θα + log θ). X is form-invariant
under w(x, β) = [ν ∗ (x)]β = e−βx since X w ∼ f w (x; θ) = e−(θ−β)(x−α) I(x > α),
but does not belong to exponential family.
    In this paper, we study the form-invariant property of the extended class of
distributions, termed as the non-regular exponential family with pdf, given by
                      p
                     nX                               o
    f (x; θ) = exp         bi (θ) di (x) + a(x) + c(θ) I                 (x), p = 1, 2,   (4)

                     i=1

where π1 (θ) < π2 (θ) for all θ ∈ Θ. The proposed class of the distributions include
two common families of distributions; non-regular family and the exponential fam-
ily, as particular cases. We identied the class of the weight functions

          W = w(.) : w(x, θ, β) = exp    βi di (x) I                            (x) ,

                                             i=1

where π1∗ (θ), π2∗ (θ) ⊆ π1 (θ), π2 (θ) and proved that a necessary and sucient

condition for a distribution to be form-invariant under w ∈ W is that its pdf is
the form (4).
    For further insights on the form-invariance, we have extended the study to
the two-parameter distributions that belong to the non-regular exponential family
and proved the necessary and sucient conditions for the form-invariance property.
Finally, some properties of the distributions belong to the nonregular-exponential
family such as the sucient and minimal sucient statistics, maximum likelihood
estimation and the Fisher information matrix are given.


2. Form-Invariance in One-Parameter Distributions

   In this Section, we extend the Patil & Ord (1976) and Alavi & Chinipardaz
(2009) results for a larger class of distributions such as nonregular-exponential
family.

be a class of weight functions which β is constant, d(x) is only function of x with
E[d(X)] < ∞ and also π1∗ and π2∗ are parametric functions of θ which π1 (θ) ≤
π1∗ (θ) < π2∗ (θ) ≤ π2 (θ) for all θ ∈ Θ. Suppose the following conditions are satised;

       both nite.

Then the distribution of X is form-invariant under w ∈ W ∗ if and only if its pdf
is as
                                                                              (5)

                     R π2 (θ)
which c(θ) = log π1 (θ) exp θ d(x) + a(x) dx < ∞.
                           


Proof . According to the dinition of form-invarince in (2), it is clear that for
each f , η is a function of β with η = θ when β = 0 and

                        π1 (θ), π2 (θ) = π1∗ (θ), π2∗ (θ) , ∀θ ∈ Θ.

Therefore, itcan be said that η = θ if and only if β = 0 and π1 (θ), π2 (θ) =
                                                                            

Now, integrating with respect to θ in (8), we get
                     log f (x; θ) = B1 (θ) d(x) + C1 (θ) + a(x)
where B1 (θ) = b1 (θ) dθ, C1 (θ) = b2 (θ) dθ and a(x) is the constant coecient
                  R                  R

of integration. Thus the pdf of X must be the form (5).
Corollary 1.    When the functions of π1 and π2 in (5) are independent of θ, the
resultant distribution is belong to exponential family. In this case, X is form-
invariant under the weight function w(x; β) = exp{β d(x) if and only if its pdf
has the form (3).
   This is studied by Patil & Ord (1976) and Alavi & Chinipardaz (2009) by
dening, respectively, d(x) = log ν(x) and d(x) = log x.
Corollary 2.     The non-regular family of distributions with the pdf as
                             f (x; θ) = c(θ)h(x) I(π1 (θ),π2 (θ) ) (x)
is a special case of (5) when d(x) = 0. In this case, X is form-invariant under the
weight function w(x, θ) = I(π1∗ (θ),π2∗ (θ) ) (x) with (π1∗ (θ), π2∗ (θ) ) ⊆ (π1 (θ), π2 (θ) ) for
all θ ∈ Θ if and only if the distribution of X belongs to non-regular family.
    Some examples of the form-invariant one-parameter distributions belong to
the non-regular exponential family with the common weight functions are given
in Table 1.


3. Form-Invariance in Two-Parameter Distributions

    The pdf of the multi-parameter distributions in nonregular exponential family
is dened as
                        nXp                            o
         f (x; θ) = exp      bi (θ)di (x) + a(x) − k(θ) I          (x),      (9)
                                                                     U1 (θ),U2 (θ)
                              i=1

where θ ∈ θ is a vector of parameters. By reparametrizing of (9), as αi = bi (θ)
and p = 2, the pdf of two-parameter distributions in nonregular exponential family
is written as
                          nX2                        o
           f (x; α) = exp     αi di (x) + a(x) − c(α) I             (x),     (10)

                                i=1

which α = α1 , α2 and
                      

                              Z π2 (α)          2

                 c(α) = log              exp         αi di (x) + a(x) dx < ∞.                (11)
                               π1 (α)          i=1

Alavi & Chinipardaz (2009) gave some examples of the form-invariant two-parameter
distributions belong to exponential family but they could not give a general ex-
pression. In this Section, we show that the form-invariant property is extensible
for all two-parameter distributions belong to non-regular exponential family.

                   η1 →α1                                η1 − α 1
By integrating to α1 , we get

           log f (x; α) = B1 (α)d1 (x) + B2 (α)d2 (x) + C1 (α) + A1 (x, α2 ).                          (15)

where Bi (α) = ai (α) dα1 , C1 (α) = t(α) dα1 and A1 (x, α2 ) is the constant of
               R                    R

integration. Thus,

                                                                                                       (16)
                       
         f (x; α) = exp B1 (α)d1 (x) + B2 (α)d2 (x) + C1 (α) + A1 (x, α2 ) .

Similarly, when η1 = α1 , η2 → α2 in (14), it is yield that

                                                                                                       (17)
                        
          f (x; α) = exp P1 (α)d1 (x) + P2 (α)d2 (x) + C2 (α) + A2 (x, α1 ) .

From (16) and (17),
                                     A1 (x, α2 ) = A2 (x, α1 ).                                        (18)
Since (18) holds for all α1 and α2 , both sides must be of the form a(x) and
independent of α. Thus the density must be the form as (10).

      that L(α) and Lw (α, β) are the increasing or decreasing functions with re-

       According to Patil & Taillie (1987), an intrinsic comparison between the
       weighted observations and original observations is possible when the dier-
       ence of the matrices, I w (α) − I(α), is either positive denite or negative
       denite. Positive (negative) deniteness of the dierence matrix means that
       every scalar-valued function of α can be estimated with smaller (larger)
       asymptotic standard error under the weighted observations. Therefore, the
       weighted observations can be or not favorable. When I w (α) − I(α) is in-
       denite, comparison of the weighted and the original observations can be
       made in terms of the comparison of scalar-valued measure of the generalized
       variance, i.e., the determinant of the Fisher information matrix. Based on
       this measure, the observations (X or X w ) that have the smallest generalized
       variance will be more favored.

5. Conclusion

    In the paper, we studied the problem of form-invariance in the non-regular
exponential family when the original distribution is subjected to a weighted dis-
tribution. The class includes many common distributions, such as Patil & Ord
(1976) and Billingsley (1979). It was shown that the maximum likelihood esti-
mator could be obtained dierently than original ones. The Fisher information
matrix for weighted distribution is compared with original distribution to show
which one is more (less) informative.
