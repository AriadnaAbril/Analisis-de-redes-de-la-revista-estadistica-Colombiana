1. Introduction

    Acceptance sampling is an important tool of statistical quality control. This
tool is used to enhance the quality of the product through the inspection from the
raw stage to the final stage. Without the proper inspection or testing the product
may cause the bad reputation of the company in the global market. Good prod-
ucts sent to the market after the inspection increase the demand and alternately
increase the profit of the company. Therefore, sampling plans have received the
attention of the industrial engineers. Various sampling plans have been widely
used in many industries including the electronic industry (Deros, Peng, Ab Rah-
man, Ismail & Sulong 2008), medical industry Fu, Tsai, Lin & Wei (2004) and
construction industry Gharaibeh, Liu & Wani (2012).
    Acceptance sampling plans are basically divided into two major categories
namely; attribute sampling plans and variables sampling plans. The attribute
sampling plans are used when the quality characteristic is just classified as good
or bad. The variable sampling plans are used when the quality characteristic of
interest can be measurable on numerical scale. The attribute sampling plans are
easy to apply, however the variable sampling plans are generally more informative
than the attribute sampling plans. Collani (1990) in one of his articles, criticized
the variable sampling plans and at the same time Seidel (1997) proved that variable
sampling plans are more optimal than the attribute sampling plans.
    The single sampling plan (SSP) is one of the widely used sampling plans in
the industries for the inspection of the finished products. This sampling plan is
easy to apply and the industrial engineers can reach a decision quickly using this
sampling plan. But, there are some other sampling schemes which are considered
more efficient than the single sampling plan. As the cost of inspection is directly
proportional to the sample size required for the acceptance or rejection decision,
a large sample size incurs a large cost for the inspection which is not favorable
for the producer and consumer. Therefore, some other sampling schemes such
as double sampling, multiple sampling, sequential sampling and skip-lot sampling
plans have been developed in order to save the cost and time of the inspection.
    The skip-lot sampling plan (SkSP) is one of the sampling schemes widely used
in the industry for the inspection purpose. The main advantage of the SkSP scheme
is to provide the inspection of the product at a low cost (Hsu 1980). This scheme
is shown to be more efficient than the single sampling plan Aslam, Wu, Azam &
Jun (2013) in terms of the minimum average sample number. Dodge (1943, 1955)
originally developed the skip-lot sampling procedure and designated it as SkSP-
1 plan. Later on, Perry (1970, 1970) discussed the applications of the SkSP-2
scheme. More details about the procedure and applications of SkSP schemes can
be seen in Bennett & Callejas (1980), MIL-STD 105D (1963), Okada (1967),
Stephens (1979), Bennett & Callejas (1980), Cox (1980), Parker & Kessler (1981),

Cao & Subramaniam (2013).
    A re-inspection procedure can be used when the experimenters need to inspect
the product again if they cannot make a decision on the basis of the original
inspection. Govindaraju & Ganesalingam (1997) originally developed the sampling
plan for resubmitted lots for the application of inspection of attribute quality
characteristics. Recently, Aslam, Balamurali, Jun & Ahmad (2013) and Wu et al.
(2012) proposed variable sampling plans using a process capability index for the
inspection of resubmitted lots. By incorporating the idea of the re-inspection
concept of Govindaraju & Ganesalingam (1997), Balamurali, Aslam & Jun (2014)
introduced a new skip-lot sampling system designated as SkSP-R for attributing
quality characteristics.
     By exploring the literature of acceptance sampling, we note that there is no
development on SkSP-R plan available for the inspection of measurable quality
characteristics. So, in this paper, we will focus on the development of the SkSP-R
sampling plan for the variables inspection by assuming that the quality charac-
teristic of interest follows a normal distribution with standard deviation a known
or unknown. We will present the designing methodology, application and the ef-
ficiency of the proposed plan. We show that the proposed plan performs better
than the existing sampling plan. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the
SkSP-R plan under variables inspection is proposed in Section 2, the designing
methodology of the SkSP-R plan under variables inspection for the known stan-
dard deviation (sigma) case is given in Section 3, the designing methodology of
the SkSP-R plan for the unknown standard deviation case is given in Section 4, a
comparison of the SkSP-R plan under variables inspection with existing sampling
plans is given in Section 5 and certain concluding remarks are given in the last
section.


2. Execution of SkSP-R Plan
    As pointed out earlier, Balamurali et al. (2014) developed a new system of
skip-lot sampling plan designated as SkSP-R, which is based on the principles
of both continuous sampling plans and the re-inspection scheme of Govindaraju
& Ganesalingam (1997) for the quality inspection of the continuous flow of bulk
products. The SkSP-R plan uses the concept of reference plan similar to the SkSP-
2 plan of Perry (1970). In this paper, the SkSP-R plan uses the variables single
sampling plan as the reference plan.
   Suppose that the quality characteristic of interest has the upper specification
limit U and follows a normal distribution with unknown mean µ and known stan-
dard deviation σ. The operating procedure of the SkSP-R plan with variables
sampling plan as the reference plan is explained below.

  1. Start with the normal inspection by applying the variables single sampling
     plan as the reference plan. During the normal inspection, lots are inspected
     one by one in order of being submitted.

  2. From each lot submitted for inspection, take a random sample of size nσ and
                                                                             (U −X̄ )
                    Pnσ characteristics(X1 , X2 , . . . , Xnσ ). Compute V =
     measure the quality
                  1
                                                                                σ     ,
     where X̄ = nσ i=1 Xi . Accept the lot if v ≥ kσ and reject the lot if v < kσ .
     (Note: In case of lower specification limit, the component v will be computed
            (X̄−L)
     as v = σ       and other calculations are the same).

  3. When i consecutive lots are accepted based on the reference plan under nor-
     mal inspection, discontinue the normal inspection and switch to the skipping
     inspection.

  4. During the skipping inspection, inspect only a fraction f of lots selected at
     random by applying the variables single sampling plan as the reference plan.
     The skipping inspection is continued until a sampled lot is rejected.

  5. When a lot is rejected after s consecutively sampled lots have been accepted,
     then go for re-inspection procedure for the immediate next lot as in step (5)
     given below.

  6. During re-inspection procedure, perform the inspection using the reference
     plan. If the lot is accepted, then continue the skipping inspection. On non-
     acceptance of the lot, re-inspection is done for m times and the lot is rejected
     if it has not been accepted on (m-1)st resubmission.

  7. If a lot is rejected on the re-inspection scheme, then we immediately revert
     to the normal inspection in Step (1).

  8. Replace or correct all the non-conforming units found with conforming units
     in the rejected lots.

     The proposed plan involves the reference plan and four parameters, namely
f (0<f <1), the fraction of lots inspected in skipping inspection mode, i, the
clearance number of normal inspection, s, the clearance number for re-inspection
procedure and m, the number of time the lots are submitted for re-inspection. In
general, i, s and m are positive integers. So, the plan is designated as SkSP-R
(i, f, s, m). The operation of the proposed plan is depicted by a flow diagram as
shown in Figure 1.



3. Known Sigma Variables SkSP-R Plan Design
    Under variables sampling inspection, an item is classified as non-conforming if
it exceeds the upper specification limit U . So, the fraction non-conforming in a
lot based on normal distribution will be defined as
                                                        
                                                   U −µ
                       p = P {Xi > U } = 1 − Φ                                 (1)

whereΦ(y)is the normal cumulative distribution function and is given by

    According to Balamurali et al. (2014), the operating characteristic (OC) func-
tion of the SkSP-R system, which gives the proportion of lots that are expected to
be accepted for specified fraction non-conforming (product quality) p is given by

                           f P + (1 − f )P i + f P s (P i − P )(1 − Qm )
              Pa (p) =                                                                      (3)
                         f (1 − P i ) [1 − P s (1 − Qm )] + P i (1 + f QP s )

whereP is the probability of acceptance of the reference plan, i.e, the probability
of accepting the lot under the variables single sampling plan with parameters (nσ ,
kσ ) and Q = 1 − P . Here P is given by

                                             P = Φ(w)
                   √
Where w = (v − kσ ) nσ and v = U −µ

    In general, any sampling plan can be designed based on two points on the
OC curve approach. A well-designed sampling plan can significantly reduce the
difference between the required and the actual existing quality of the products.
The producer usually would focus on a specific level of product quality, called
acceptable quality level (AQL), which would yield a high probability for accepting
a lot. Alternatively, the consumer would also focus on another point at the other
end of the OC curve, called limiting quality level (LQL). So, the producer wants


                                             Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 413–429

the probability of acceptance at AQL to be larger than his confidence level (1 − α)
and the consumer desires that the lot acceptance probability at LQL should be
less than his risk β. That is, the acceptance sampling plan must have its OC
curve passing through those two designated points (AQL, 1 − α) and (LQL, β).
Generally the AQL is denoted by p1 and the LQL is denoted by p2 .
   The OC function of the SkSP-R variables plan at the AQL (= p1 ) and LQL
(= p2 ) satisfying the corresponding producer’s risk α and consumer’s risk β are
respectively given as

                       f P1 + (1 − f )P1i + f P1s (P1i − P1 )(1 − Qm
                                                                   1 )

                       f (1 − P2 ) [1 − P2 (1 − Q2 )] + P2 (1 + f Q2 P2s )
where P1 = Φ(w1 ), which is the probability of acceptance of the reference plan at
AQL, Q = 1 − Φ(w1 ), P2 = Φ(w2 ), which is the probability of acceptance of the
reference plan at LQL and Q2 = 1 − Φ(w2 ). Here w1 is the value of w at p = p1 ,
w2 is the value of w at p = p2 . That is,
                                √                             √
                 w1 = (v1 − kσ ) nσ        and w2 = (v2 − kσ ) nσ                     (6)

wherev1 is the value of v at AQL and v2 is the value of v at LQL.
   For given AQL or LQL, the values of i, f, s, m, kσ and the sample size nσ are
determined by formulating a nonlinear optimization problem. Throughout this
paper, we consider s = i and m = 2 as suggested by Govindaraju & Ganesalingam
(1997) in order to reduce the number of parameters. The average sample number
(ASN), by definition, means the expected number of sampled units required for
making a decision about the lot. It is also known that the ASN of the known
sigma SkSP-R plan is given as (see Balamurali et al. 2014)

                            nf + nf QP i+s − nf P s (1 − P i )(1 − Qm )
            ASN (p) =                                                                 (7)
                          f (1 − P i ) [1 − P s (1 − Qm )] + P i (1 + f QP s )
The ASN at AQL and LQL respectively of the SkSP-R plan when s=i are given
as
                        nf + nf Q1 P12i − nf P1i (1 − P1i )(1 − Qm  1 )
         ASN (p1 ) =                                                     (8)

and
                             nf + nf Q2 P22i − nf P2i (1 − P2i )(1 − Qm  2 )
           ASN (p2 ) =                                                              (9)

                                                               2          2 2

    The ASN given above can be used as an objective function to be minimized in
a nonlinear optimization problem since there are several choices for the objective
function, it is considered here to minimize ASN at LQL given in (9) because it
is larger than the ASN at AQL. Therefore, the problem will be reduced to the
following nonlinear optimization problem.

   To solve the above problem finding of optimal parameters of (i, f, nσ , kσ ), we
use a grid search procedure. The parameters (i, f, nσ , kσ ) for the known sigma plan
are determined by six combinations of (α, β) namely (0.05, 0.1), (0.01,0.1),(0.01,
0.05), which are reported in Tables 1-3.

    Suppose that a quality characteristic has the upper specification limit U and
the lower specification limit L and that an item having the quality characteristic
beyond these limits is declared as nonconforming. The nominal-best quality char-
acteristics usually have double specification limits. It is to be pointed out that in
the case of double specification limits, the designing methodology is slightly differ-
ent. However, a one sided case serves as a reasonable approximation. The sampling
plans based on double specification limits have been investigated by many authors
(see for example Lee, Aslam & Hun, 2012).


Example 1. For example, if p1 = 0.005, p2 = 0.01, α = 0.05 and β = 0.10, Table
1 gives the optimal parameters as nσ =49, kσ = 2.51998, i =3 and f =0.05. Hence
the optimal parameters of the SkSP-R plan for the specified requirements are i =3,
f =0.05, s=3, m=2, nσ =49 and kσ = 2.51998. For this plan, the probability of
acceptance at AQL is 0.95259 and ASN at LQL is 48.382.

4. Designing of Unknown Sigma SkSP-R Plan

    Whenever the standard deviation is unknown, we should use the sample stan-
dard deviation S instead of σ. In this case, the operation of the reference plan is
as follows.
   Step 1: From each submitted
                                  lot, take a   random sample of size nS and measure
the quality characteristics X1 , X2 , . . . , XnS
                                                                        qP
                          (U −X̄ )                    PnS                    (Xi −X)2
   Step 2: Computev = S , where X̄ = n1S i=1               Xi and S =         nS −1   .
   Accept the lot if v ≥ kS and reject the lot if v < kS .
    The operation of SkSP-R plan for unknown sigma case is exactly the same as
in the known sigma case, but the only difference is that the reference plan will be
operated as mentioned above.

    Thus, the unknown sigma variable SkSP-R plan has the parameters namely,
i, s, m along with the sample size nS , and the acceptable criterion kS . The OC
function for the unknown sigma case is different from the known sigma case. It is
known that X ± kS Sis approximately normally distributed with mean µ ± kS E(S)
               2
and variance nσS + kS V ar(S) (see Duncan 1986, Balamurali & Jun 2006). That is,

                                              σ2         2
                                                          
                                                     2 σ
                     X + kS S ∼ N µ + kS σ,       + kS
                                              nS       2nS
Therefore, the probability of accepting a lot is given by
                                             
                  P X ≤ U − kS S |p = P X + kS S ≤ U |p
                                                                
                                                          s
                       U − kS σ − µ                          nS 
              = Φ                        = Φ (v − kS )
                        √                                       k2
                              q       2
                                     kS                     1 + 2S
                    (σ/ nS ) 1 + 2
                                    !
                            r
                                nS
If we let, wS = (v − kS )        k2
                                      , then the probability of accepting a lot is
                                     1+ 2S
considered as Φ(wS ).
   Hence the lot acceptance probability for the sigma unknown case of SkSP-R
should satisfy the following two inequalities at AQL and LQL:
                           f P1 + (1 − f )P1i + f P1s (P1i − P1 )(1 − Qm
                                                                       1 )
            Pa (p1 ) =                                                       ≥1−α          (11)
                                 i         s        m         i
                         f (1 − P1 ) [1 − P1 (1 − Q1 )] + P1 (1 + f Q1 P1s )
and
                             f P2 + (1 − f )P2i + f P2s (P2i − P2 )(1 − Qm 2 )
              Pa (p2 ) =                                                         ≤β        (12)
                           f (1 − P2i ) [1 − P2s (1 − Qm
                                                       2 )] + P i (1 + f Q P s )
                                                                2         2 2

where P1 = Φ(w1S ),Q = 1 − Φ(w1S ), P2 = Φ(w2S )and Q2 = 1 − Φ(w2S ). Here
w1S is the value of w at p=p1 , w2S is the value of w at p=p2 . That is,
                                √                            √
                w1S = (v1 − kS ) nS and w2S = (v2 − kS ) nS              (13)

   wherev1 is the value of v at AQL and v2 is the value of v at LQL. In this case,
the nonlinear optimization problem becomes
                                  nf +nf Q P i+s −nf P k (1−P i )(1−Qm )
                                       2 2
      Minimize ASN (p2 ) = f (1−P i ) 1−P         2      2      2

                                  2 [      2 (1−Q2 )]+P2 (1+f Q2 P2 )

      Subject to Pa (p1 ) ≥ 1 − α
                                        Pa (p2 ) ≤ β
                             nS > 1, kS > 0, i ≥ 1, m = 2, s = i                           (14)
     We may determine the parameters of the unknown sigma SkSP-R plan by
solving the nonlinear problem given in (14). For given AQL or LQL, the values of
i, f, s, m, kS and the sample size nS are determined by using a search procedure.
The parameters (i, f, s, m, nS , kS ) for the unknown sigma plan are determined for
six combinations of (α, β) namely (0.05, 0.1), (0.01, 0.1), (0.01, 0.05), which are
reported in Tables 4-6.

Example 2. For example, i fp1 = 0.005, p2 = 0.01, α = 0.05 and β = 0.10, Table
4 gives the optimal parameters as nS = 204, kS = 2.51998, i = 3 and f = 0.05.
Hence the optimal parameters of the SkSP-R plan for the specified requirements
are i = 3, f = 0.05, s = 3, m = 2, nS = 204, kS = 2.51998. For this plan, the
probability of acceptance at AQL is 0.95251 and ASN at LQL is 201.403.



5. Comparison
   In this section we compare the variables SkSP-R plan with the variables single
sampling plan. For this purpose we provide Table 7 which gives the ASN values at
LQL of both sampling plans with α = 5% and β = 10% for various combinations of
AQL and LQL. For the comparison, we have considered both known and unknown
standard deviation sampling plans.

    From this table, it is clearly understood that the ASN of variables SkSP-R plan
is considerably smaller as compared to the variables single sampling plan for any
combinations of AQL and LQL. For example, if p1 = 0.01 and p2 = 0.03, Table 7
gives the ASN of the variables single sampling plan and variables SkSP-R plan as
44 and 14.807 for the known sigma case. It indicates that the variables SkSP-R
plan achieves a reduction of over 66% in ASN compared to the ASN of the s,
the ASN values are obtained from Table 7 as 137 and 52.352 respectively for the
variables single sampling plan and the variables SkSP-R plan under the unknown
sigma case. By comparing these values, we conclude that the variables SkSP-R
plan achieves over a 61% reduction in ASN over the variables single sampling
plan. However it is to be pointed out that the SkSP-R plan does not offer the
same protection as the variables single sampling plan except under the stationary
conditions of the underlying Markov chain requiring a higher number of lots of
the same quality to achieve conditions. Under periods of changing quality, like the
onset of a problem, the protection offered by SkSP-R plan is considerably lesser

maintains the protection represented by the AQL and LQL under all transitive
conditions of changing quality.



6. Conclusions
     The SkSP-R sampling plan is designed for the variable data in this paper. The
necessary measures of the proposed plan for known and unknown standard devi-
ation of normal distribution have been derived. The proposed plan can be used
in the industry when the quality of interest follows the normal distribution. The
efficiency of the proposed plan over the existing plan is studied. The proposed
plan performs better than the existing variables single sampling plan in terms
of minimum ASN. The application of the proposed plan in the industry can re-
duce the inspection cost. The extensive tables have been developed for various

combinations of AQL and LQL and various producer and consumer risks are pro-
vided for this purpose. The proposed plan for non-normal distributions will be
considered as future research. The current study only considers the case of con-
stant process fraction non-conforming. The performance of the proposed plan
should be evaluated for the case of shifted fraction non-conforming in a future
study.
