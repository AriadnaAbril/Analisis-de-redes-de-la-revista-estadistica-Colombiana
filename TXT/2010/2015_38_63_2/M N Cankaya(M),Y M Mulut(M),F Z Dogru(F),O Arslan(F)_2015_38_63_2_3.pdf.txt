Abstract
A bimodal extension of the generalized gamma distribution is proposed by using a mixing approach. Some distributional properties of the new distribution are investigated. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimators for the parameters of the new distribution are obtained. Real data examples are given to show the strength of the new distribution for modeling data.
Key words: Bimodality, Exponential Power Distribution, Generalized Gamma, Skewness.

1. Introduction
    It is not known how the real data behaves. In order to model the real data
sets, a parametric model which is flexible enough to capture the data features is
needed. In this paper, we propose a family of distribution with two important
properties. One of these properties is bimodality and the other is skewness. The
data sets, which may have bimodality and/or skewness, can be efficiently modeled
with these two properties.
    Hassan & Hijazi (2010) define a bimodal exponential power distribution, but
their bimodal distribution has the same level of peaks and it is symmetric. There-
fore, their distribution may not be very useful for data sets that have two modes
with different frequencies of the observations and the asymmetry.
   When exploring the literature on bimodal and skew distributions, there are
many different proposals. Some of these works are (Eugene, Lee & Famoye
2002, Famoye, Lee & Eugene 2004, Ahmed, Goria & Hussein 2008, Sanhueza,

2014, Gómez, Bolfarine & Gómez 2014, Celik, Senoglu & Arslan 2015, Iriarte,
Gómez, Varela & Bolfarine 2015). The model proposed by Abdulah & Elsalloukh
(2014) has a bimodality with the same height, which is not flexible enough to
model bimodal data with a different number of observations in each group.
   In this study, we define a new distribution as a scale mixture of the generalized
gamma distribution. The resulting distribution has six parameters. Two of these
parameters are the shape parameters which control the height of peaks. The
other four parameters regulate the peakness, the skewness and the tail thickness.
With these parameters, the model is more flexible than the previously proposed
bimodal distributions for modeling bimodal data sets which may have skewness in
each group.
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the new distribution
and give some distributional properties. Maximum likelihood estimations are given
in Section 3. In Section 4, we give the real data examples. Finally, in the last
section we give some conclusions and remarks.



2. Bimodal Generalized Gamma Distribution
   It is easy to show that if W ∼ G( δ+1      β
                                        αβ , η ), δ > 0, α > 0, β > 0, and η > 0, then
                              1/β
the random variable Y = W         will have a generalized gamma (GG) distribution
with the density function

Then, the derivatives of F1 (x) and F0 (x) give the density function f (x) with the aid
of the Leibniz integral rule. When we plot this, we observe that both peaks have
the same height. To make this density function more flexible, we can reparametrize
it by taking δ = δ1 for x < 0, δ = δ0 for x ≥ 0. If we do so, we can get the f (x)
function given equation (4). To show that f (x) is a density function, we have to
prove that

For the first integration, let u = η1β ( 1+ε ) . Using this, we can easily see that
                                    Z 0
                                                       1+ε

Similarly, for the second part of equation (5), let u = η1β ( 1−ε

Thus, the desired result is obtained.
Definition 1. The distribution of the random variable X with the density function
given in equation (4) is called a bimodal extended generalized gamma (BEGG)
distribution.

   We can also define the location-scale form of this distribution.
Proposition 1. Suppose that Z ∼ BEGG(α, β, δ0 , δ1 , η, ε). Then, the random
variable X = µ+σZ, µ ∈ R, σ > 0 will have BEGG distribution with the following
density function (X ∼ BEGG(µ, σ, α, β, δ0 , δ1 , η, ε))

                   2ση α (1+ε)δ1 Γ( 1αβ )

where µ and σ are the location and the scale parameters, respectively.

Proof . Let Z ∼ BEGG(α, β, δ0 , δ1 , η, ε). If we replaced Z by X−µ
                                                                 σ    with the
Jacobian 1/σ in the density function of Z, then we get the probability density
function given in equation (6).

Proof . If r = 1, then E(X) is the first moment. If r = 2, then E(X 2 ) is the
second moment. Thus, V (X) = E(X 2 ) − [E(X)]2 .

Proof . Recall that the Hazard function has the form h(x) = 1−F    (x) . Using this
formulae, we can easily get the Hazard function given in equation (9). Note that
since the probability density function and the cumulative density function come
in two parts, the Hazard function also has two parts.

    Figures 1 and 2 display some examples of the density function and correspond-
ing cdfs of the BEGG distribution for some values of parameters. From these
figures, we can see bimodality and skewness and we can also observe that if we
take different values of δ0 and δ1 we can get the modes with different heights.

          values of parameters.



    The parameters α and β control the kurtosis. The distribution is leptokurtic
for α ∈ (0, 2) and β = 1, and it is platikurtic for α ∈ (2, ∞) and β = 1. The
parameters δ0 and δ1 control the bimodality. The parameter ε and η control the
skewness and the tail thickness, respectively.


2.2. Special Cases
   • If δ0 = δ1 , the density function will have two modes with the same height.
     If δ0 = δ1 = 0, the distribution will be a unimodal.

   • When ε = 0, the distribution will be symmetric with two modes with different
     height.

   • When α = 2, β = 1, δ0 = δ1 = 0, η = 2, and ε = 0, the distribution will
     be a standard normal distribution. Location µ and scale σ case of BEGG
     distribution is defined in equation (6).

   • If α = 1, β = 1,δ0 = δ1 = 0, η = 1, and ε = 0, the distribution is the Laplace
     distribution with the parameters location µ and scale σ in equation (6).

   • If β = 1, δ0 = δ1 = δ, η = 1, ε = 0, the distribution is the bimodal exponential
     power distribution proposed by Hassan & Hijazi (2010).

   • The ε-skew exponential power distribution proposed by Elsalloukh, Guardi-
     ola & Young (2005) is a special case of this family for β = 1, δ0 = δ1 = 0
     and η = 2α/2 .
   • For the case δ0 = δ1 = k − 1, α = 1, β = 1, the BEGG distribution becomes
     ε-skew gamma distribution proposed by Abdulah & Elsalloukh (2013).
   • For the case α = 2, β = 1, δ0 = δ1 = 0, η = 2, the distribution becomes the
     extended skew normal distribution proposed by Arellano-Valle et al. (2010).

   • When α = 2, β = 1, δ0 = δ1 = 0 and η = 2, the distribution is the ε-skew
     normal distribution proposed by Mudholkar & Hutson (2000).

 Since these equations cannot be solved analytically, the numerical methods should
be used to obtain the M L estimates. Since the random variable has scale mixture
format the EM algorithm can be used to obtain the M L estimates. In this paper,
we will use the R package called BB proposed by Varadhan & Gilbert (2009) to
get the solutions of these equations. It should be noted that the BB package
also uses the EM algorithm to solve the system of nonlinear equations like these
equations.


4. Real Data Examples
    In this section real data sets will be used to illustrate the modeling capability
of the proposed distribution. We used two data sets. Here, data sets will be
modeled with the BEGG distribution. We first standardize the data set to get rid
of estimating the location and the scale.

Example 1. The data set, which is called duration of Geyser data, is given in
M ASS package in R. This data set is also used by Abdulah & Elsalloukh (2014).
It consists of n = 299 observations, and preliminary examination of this data set
shows bimodality (see Figure 3). Figure 3 shows the histogram of the data set with

fitted densities from BEGG, ESIG (Epsilon Skew Inverted Gamma) and BEP
(Bimodal Exponential Power) distributions. In Table 1 and 2, the estimates of the
parameters and the log-likelihood, AIC, BIC are given, respectively. We can see
that the proposed distribution can capture the bimodality and accurately model
the data. It has the smallest AIC and BIC among these three distributions.

Example 2. In this example we will use the height data set which consists of
height of 126 students from the University of Pennsylvania (Cruz-Medina 2001).
The same data set is also considered by Hassan & Hijazi (2010). In this paper
we used the BEGG distribution to model the data set. In Table 3 and 4, the
estimates for the parameters, the log-likelihood, AICs and BICs are given for
the BEGG, ESIG and BEP distributions, respectively. From AIC and BIC, we
observe that BEGG distribution again has the smallest AIC and BIC. In Figure
4, the histogram of the data set and fitted densities from the above distributions

are displayed. This figure also confirms that the BEGG distribution provides a
better fit than the other distributions in terms of capturing the bimodality. Note
that for this data set the estimate for the skewness parameter is 0.026275 which
indicates that the skewness is not a serious problem.

5. Conclusions
    We have proposed a new family of bimodal distributions. The advantage of the
new family is that the data sets that may have bimodal empirical distribution with
different numbers of observations in each mode can be easily modeled using the
distributions in this family. We have shown that many of the well known distribu-
tions are special or limiting cases of this family. Therefore, the new family can be
considered as a unified family of the bimodal distributions defined in this fashion.

                                                                Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 371–384

We have provided some examples to show the strength of this family for modeling
bimodality and skewness. We have observed from these examples that the dis-
tributions that belong to the new family can provide alternative distributions to
model bimodality.
