Abstract
Bayesian analysis of the 3-component mixture of an Exponential distribution under type-I right censoring scheme is considered in this paper. The Bayes estimators and posterior risks for the unknown parameters are derived under squared error loss function, precautionary loss function and DeGroot loss function assuming the non-informative (uniform and Jeffreys’) priors. The Bayes estimators and posterior risks are viewed as a function of the test termination time. A simulation study is given to highlight and compare the properties of the Bayes estimates.
Key words: Mixture Model, Bayes Estimators, Exponential Distribution, Loss Function, Posterior Risks.

 1. Introduction
    When a population is supposed to comprise a number of subpopulations mixed
in an unknown proportion then common available distributions are irrelevant, e.g.
a population of lifetime of certain electrical elements or medicines may be divided
into a number of subpopulations depending upon the possible cause of failure. To
model such populations in the engineering, physical sciences, chemical, biological
sciences, and other fields, mixture models are used. As examples, Harris (1983)
fitted mixture distributions to modeling the crime and justice data, Kanji (1985)
described wind shear data using mixture distributions. Jones & McLachlan (1990)
applied the mixture of normal distribution and Laplace distribution to wind shear
data.
    An Exponential distribution, because of its memory-less property, has many
real life applications in testing the objects that do not depend upon their age
(Rao 2012). There are many electronic devices whose failure rate does not de-
pend on their age with time, therefore, an Exponential distribution is a suitable
choice to model lifetimes of such devices. Suppose, a population of such devices is
composed of three subpopulations (taken as Exponential) mixed by two unknown
proportions. Some applications of mixture of Exponential distributions are in or-
der. McCullagh (1994) derived some conditions under which quadratic and poly-
nomial Exponential models can be generated as mixtures of Exponential models.
Hebert & Scariano (2005) compared the location estimators for Exponential mix-
tures under Pitman’s measure of closeness. Raqab & Ahsanullah (2001) discussed
the location and scale parameters of generalized Exponential distribution based
on order statistics. Ali, Woo & Nadarajah (2005) studied the Bayes estimators of
an Exponential distribution and Abu-Taleb, Smadi & Alawneh (2007) presented
the Bayesian estimation of the lifetime parameters for an Exponential distribution
when survival time and censoring time are both exponentially distributed.
    The mixture of the probability density functions from the same family is known
as type-I mixture model and type-II mixture model is defined as a mixture of den-
sity functions from several families. Motivated by the above mentioned studies,
the current study, a 3-component mixture of Exponential distributions is consid-
ered to model such a population provided the random observations are not given
for each component but rather for the overall mixture distribution only.
    This study provides the Bayesian analysis of the 3-component mixture of an
Exponential distribution assuming the uniform prior (UP) and the Jeffreys’ prior
(JP). Estimations through the squared error loss function (SELF), precautionary
loss function (PLF) and DeGroot loss function (DLF) are also discussed. The
interaction of using the 3-component mixture model is that, in the current sit-
uation, the researchers are able to define estimates and make predictions about
the complicated system by using strong and complicated computational methods.
The Bayesian technique to analyze the 3-component mixture model has developed
an interest between researchers. Most of the researchers worked on the Bayesian
analysis of the 2-component mixture models. Sinha (1998) used the Bayesian coun-
terpart of the maximum likelihood estimates of the 2-component mixture model
considered by Mendenhall & Hader (1958). Saleem & Aslam (2009) discussed

the use of the informative and the non-informative priors for Bayesian analysis
of the 2-component mixture of the Rayleigh distribution. Also, Saleem, Aslam &
Economou (2010) presented the Bayesian analysis of the 2-component mixture of
the Power distribution using the complete and censored sample. Kazmi, Aslam
& Ali (2012) described the Bayesian analysis for the 2-component mixture of the
Maxwell distribution.
     Censoring is an important and valuable aspect of the lifetime data. In real
life most of the time, it is not suitable that the testing procedure continues until
is reached the last value of the data set. Censoring is a form of primary quality
and missing life time data problems. A valuable account of censoring is given
in Romeu (2004), Gijbels (2010) and Kalbfleisch & Prentice (2011). There are
three main types of censoring i.e., (i) right censoring, (ii) left censoring and (iii)
interval censoring. In this paper an ordinary type-I right censoring is used with
fixes life-test termination time for all objects.
   The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. The 3-component mixture of
an Exponential distribution is given in Section 2. The posterior distributions
assuming the UP and the JP are presented in Section 3. The Bayes estimators
and their posterior risks using the Up and the JP under SELF, PLF and DLF
are defined in Sections 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The simulation study is made in
Section 7. Finally, the conclusion of this study is given in Section 8.


2. 3-Component Mixture of an Exponential
   Distribution
   The probability density function (p.d.f.) of an Exponential distribution for
random variable X is:
             fm (x; θm ) = θm exp(−θm x),         x ≥ 0, θm > 0, m = 1, 2, 3            (1)
where θm is a parameter of an Exponential distribution. The cumulative distribu-
tion function for random variable X is:
                       Fm (x) = 1 − exp(−θm x),          m = 1, 2, 3                    (2)
A finite 3-component mixture model with the unknown mixing proportions p1 and
p2 is:
   f (x) = p1 f1 (x) + p2 f2 (x) + (1 − p1 − p2 )f3 (x),     p1 , p2 ≥ 0, p1 + p2 ≤ 1   (3)

             f (x; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , p1 , p2 ) = p1 θ1 exp(−θ1 x) + p2 θ2 exp(−θ2 x)
                                                                                        (4)
                                      + (1 − p1 − p2 )θ3 exp(−θ3 x)
The cumulative distribution function of 3-component mixture model is:
                  F (x) = p1 F1 (x) + p2 F2 (x) + (1 − p1 − p2 )F3 (x)                  (5)

       F (x) = 1 − p1 exp(−θ1 x) − p2 exp(−θ2 x) − (1 − p1 − p2 ) exp(−θ3 x)            (6)

3. The Posterior Distributions Assuming the
   Non-informative Priors
   The posterior distribution of parameters given data x is derived assuming the
non-informative (uniform and Jeffreys’) priors.


3.1. The Likelihood Function
    Suppose n units are used in a life testing experiment from the 3-component
mixture model. Let r units out of n units failed until fixed test termination
time t and the remaining n − r units are still working. According to Mendenhall
& Hader (1958), there are many practical situations in which the failed objects
can be pointed out easily as subsets of either subpopulation-I or subpopulation-
II or subpopulation-III. Out of r units, suppose r1 , r2 and r3 units belong to
subpopulation-I, subpopulation-II and subpopulation-III respectively and such
that r = r1 + r2 + r3 . Now we define xlk , 0 < xlk ≤ t, be the failure time of
k th unit belonging to lth subpopulation, l = 1, 2, 3 and k = 1, 2, . . . , rl . So the
likelihood function of the 3-component mixture model for the random sample x is:
                       r1
                       Y                      r2

3.2. The Posterior Distribution Assuming the UP and
     the JP
    When elicitation of hyperparameters is difficult and little or no prior informa-
tion is given then we use the non-informative prior. The UP and the JP are the

most common non-informative priors. Bayes (1763), de Laplace (1820) and Geisser
(1984) proposed that may take the uniform distribution for the unknown param-
eters of interest. Following Bayes (1763), de Laplace (1820) and Geisser (1984),
in this study, we assume the UP over the interval (0, ∞) for the scale parameters
θ1 , θ2 and θ3 of an Exponential distribution and the UP over the interval (0, 1) for
the mixing proportions p1 and p2 . So the joint prior distribution of parameters
θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , p1 , and p2 is:

                     Π1 (Ψ ) ∝ 1,      θ1 , θ2 , θ3 > 0, p1 , p2 ≥ 0, p1 + p2 ≤ 1               (10)

Jeffreys (1946), Jeffreys (1961), Bernardop (1979) and Berger (1985) discussed
the hJP. The JP
              i  is defined as: p(θ m ) ∝  | I(θm ) |, m = 1, 2, 3, where I(θm ) =
       2
−E ∂ f∂θ (x|θm )
           2     is the Fisher’s information matrix. The prior distributions of the
           m
mixing proportions p1 and p2 are again assumed as the uniform distribution over
the interval (0,1). Assuming the independence of parameters, the joint prior dis-
tribution of parameters θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , p1 , and p2 is:
                                 1
                  Π2 (Ψ ) ∝            ,   θ1 , θ2 , θ3 > 0, p1 , p2 ≥ 0, p1 + p2 ≤ 1           (11)
                              θ1 θ2 θ3
This prior will be considered as the JP of the parameters of 3-component of an
Exponential distribution. The joint posterior distribution of parameters θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ,
p1 and p2 given data x assuming the UP and the JP is:

4. The Bayes Estimators and Posterior Risks
   Assuming the UP and the JP under SELF
    If L(θ, d) is a loss function then the expected value of the loss function for a
given decision with respect to the posterior distribution is posterior risk function
and if db is a Bayes estimator then ρ(d)  b is called posterior risk and is defined

(1806) to develop the least square theory. Chin-Chuan, Liang-Yuh & Hsin-Lin
(2003) discussed the SELF for process capability estimation under different priors.
By using SELF the Bayes estimators and posterior risk are: db = Eθ|x (θ) and
   b = Eθ|x (θ2 ) − {Eθ|x (θ)}2 , respectively. So the Bayes estimators and posterior
ρ(d)
risks assuming the UP and the JP for parameters θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , p1 and p2 under SELF
are obtained with respective marginal posterior distribution as:

5. The Bayes Estimators and Posterior Risks
   Assuming the UP and the JP under PLF
    Norstrom (1996) discussed an asymmetric precautionary loss function (PLF)
and a special case of general class of precautionary loss functions is: L(θ, d) =
(θ−d)2                                                                      1
   d   . The Bayes estimators and posterior risk are: db = {Eθ|x (θ2 )} 2 and
                     1
   b = 2{Eθ|x (θ2 )} 2 − 2Eθ|x (θ), respectively. The respective marginal posterior
ρ(d)
distribution yields the Bayes estimators and posterior risks assuming the UP and
the JP for parameters θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , p1 and p2 under PLF as:

6. The Bayes Estimators and Posterior Risks
   Assuming the UP and the JP under DLF
    DeGroot (2005) introduced the asymmetric loss function: L(θ, d) = ( θ−d         2
                                                                                 d ) ,
which is DLF.The Bayes estimators and their posterior risk under DLF are: d =     b
Eθ|x (θ 2 )            {Eθ|x (θ)}2
 Eθ|x (θ) and ρ(d) = 1− Eθ|x (θ 2 ) , respectively. The Bayes estimators and posterior
                b
risks assuming the UP and the JP for parameters θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , p1 and p2 under DLF
are:

7. Simulation Study
    A simulation study is done to investigate the performance and highlight the
properties of the Bayes estimates (BEs) of the 3-component mixture of an Ex-
ponential distribution using the UP and the JP in terms of different sample
sizes, test termination times and loss functions. Samples of different sizes i.e.,
n = 30, 100, 200, 500 were generated from the 3-component mixture of an Ex-
ponential distribution with different combinations of parameters (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) ∈
{(2, 3, 4), (4, 3, 2), (3, 3, 3)} and (p1 , p2 ) ∈ {(0.3, 0.5), (0.5, 0.3), (0.4, 0.4)}. The p1 n
observations were taken randomly from first component density f1 (x; θ1 ), p2 n ob-
servations were chosen randomly from second component density f2 (x; θ2 ) and
remaining (1 − p1 − p2 )n observations were selected randomly from third com-
ponent density f3 (x; θ3 ). A sample censored at a fixed test termination time t
such that t = 0.5, 0.8, is selected to check the impact of test termination time on
BEs. The observations which are greater than t were considered as censored ones.
Only failures can be identified as a member of subpopulation-I or subpopulation-II
or subpopulation-III of the 3-component mixture model. By using Mathematica
package, each time 1000 samples were generated and BEs and posterior risks (PRs)
were computed under SELF, PLF and DLF.
    It is observed from Tables 1-6 that the PRs of BEs using the UP and the
JP under SELF, PLF and DLF are reduced with an increase in sample size at
different test termination times. For large test termination time, the PRs of BEs
assuming the UP and the JP under SELF, PLF and DLF are less than the PRs of
BEs of small test termination time at different sample sizes because we get more
information from samples. An important feature about selection of the UP and the
JP under SELF, PLF and DLF based on PR, the JP due to less PR under SELF
and PLF is more efficient and preferable as compared to the UP but we can’t
identify which prior is suitable under DLF due to the mix pattern for different
sample sizes. The same observation is made for the different test termination
times. While comparing three different loss functions, considered in this study,
it is observed that the PRs of BEs of component parameters θ1 , θ2 and θ3 using
the UP and the JP under PLF are smaller than SELF but larger than DLF at

different sample sizes, so in that case DLF is more preferable. Again the same
observation is made for different test termination times resulting in deciding DLF
as the suitable loss function. However, the SELF is observed to be a more suitable
choice for estimating the proportion parameters p1 and p2 when either the UP or
the JP is taken as non-informative prior.
    From Tables 1-6, it can be seen that the component parameters are over-
estimated using the UP and the JP under SELF, PLF and DLF for different sample
sizes at a fix test termination time. Similarly, for a fix sample size, the BEs provide
an over-estimate of the component parameters at varying test termination times. If
θ1 < θ2 < θ3 , the extent of over-estimation of the BEs of first component parameter
θ1 is greater than θ2 and θ3 with a few exceptions. Similarly, the over-estimation
of the BEs of third component parameter θ3 is also greater than θ1 and θ2 with a
few exceptions in both the cases when θ1 > θ2 > θ3 and θ1 = θ2 = θ3 . Also, the
extent of over-estimation of the BEs of component parameters is greater for small
test termination time as compared to large test termination time. The extent of
over-estimation reduces to zero when either sample size or test termination time
is increased.


8. Conclusion
    The importance and application of mixture models in real life problems is un-
deniable. There are many advantages of Bayesian analysis over classical analysis.
The main advantage is that additional information is provided by prior distribution
for making Bayesian inference. In this study, we have considered the Bayesian
analysis of 3-componenten mixture of an Exponential distribution assuming non-
informative priors under different loss functions. The closed form expressions of
posterior distributions, Bayes estimators and posterior risks have been derived.
To judge relative performance of the Bayes estimators, an extensive simulation
study has been conducted. From simulated results, we observed that an increase
in sample size or test termination time provides improved BEs. In particular, we
observed that for different sample sizes at a fixed test termination time, component
parameters θ1 , θ2 and θ3 using the UP and the JP under SELF, PLF and DLF are
over-estimated and the same is the case with different test termination times at a
fixed sample size. Furthermore, as sample size (test termination time) increases
the PRs of BEs decrease for a fixed test termination time (sample size). Also, the
DLF (SELF) is observed as a suitable choice for estimating component parameters
(mixing proportions). Finally, we conclude that the JP is more suitable prior
under SELF for estimating the proportion parameters. In this case, when DLF is
considered, both the UP and the JP are suitable priors for component parameters
but JP is more suitable when PLF is used to estimate the component parameters.
