Abstract
The present study is basically meant to propose an improved item count technique which will mainly have an impact on sensitive fields such as health care. It is attempted to highlight the scope of the proposal relative to the usual and existing methods serving the same purpose. The proposed improved Item Count Technique (ICT) has the major advantage that it does not require two subsamples (as is the case in usual ICT) and there is no need of finding optimum subsample sizes. The proposed ICT has been observed performing well, as compared to the usual ICT, in terms of relative efficiency. The innovative method of Randomized Response (RR) technique has also been compared with the proposed ICT and it is found that the proposed technique uniformly performs better when the number of innocuous items is greater than 3.
Key words: Health surveys, Privacy, Proportion estimation, Randomized response, Sensitive question.
Resumen
El presente articulo propone una técnica de conteo de items con aplicaciones principalmente en el campo de la salud. Se muestran las ventajas de nuestra propuesta y de otros métodos que sirven con el mismo fin. La técnica de conteo de ítems propuesta (ICT, por su sigla en inglés) tiene la ventaja de que no requiere dos submuestras (como es el caso en el ICT clásico) y no es necesario de encontrar los tamaños de las submuestras óptimos. El ICT propuesto tiene un mejor comportamiento en términos de eficiencia relativa. El método de la técnica de respuesta aleatorizada (RR, por su sigla en inglés) es también comparado con el ICT propuesto y se encuentra que la técnica propuesta se desempeña mejor cuando el número de ítems inocuos es mayor de 3.

1. Introduction
    In estimating the population proportion of a sensitive characteristic (induced
abortion, shoplifting, tax evasion) through direct questioning, truthfulness of the
answers may be suspected due to various reasons, namely, social stigma, embar-
rassment, monetary penalty, and many others. These and similar other factors are
directly related to the health issues and some improved/alternative techniques to
hit these areas are indispensable to address the complications involved in them.
There are a number of papers showing such concerns. Some literature in this
regard may be seen in Bjorner, Kosinski   Ware (2003) and Martin, Kosinski,
Bjorner, Ware   MacLean (2007), and the references therein.
    An ingenious alternative to direct questioning introduced by Warner (1965),
known as Randomized Response Technique (RRT), has been developed rapidly.
For a good review of developments on RRTs we would refer the reader to Tracy &
Mangat (1996) and Chaudhuri   Mukherjee (1988). The RRT has been used in
many studies including Liu   Chow (1976), Reinmuth   Geurts (1975), Geurts
(1980), Larkins, Hume   Garcha (1997), etc. Geurts (1980) reported that RRT
had financial limitations since it requires larger sample sizes to obtain the con-
fidence intervals comparable to the direct questioning technique. More time is
needed to administer and explain the procedure to the survey respondents. In
addition, tabulation and calculation of the results are comparatively laborious.
Larkins et al. (1997) found that RRT was not a good alternative for estimating
the proportion of tax payers/non-payers. Dalton   Metzger (1992) were of the
view that RRT might not be effective through a mailed or telephonic survey. Hub-
bard, Casper   Lessler (1989) stated that the main technical problem for RRTs
is making the decision about what kind of the randomization device would be the
best in a given situation, and that the most crucial aspect of the RRT is about the
respondent’s acceptance of the technique. Chaudhuri   Christofides (2007) also
gave a criticism on the RRT in the sense that it demands the respondent’s skill
of handling the device and also asks respondents to report the information which
may be useless or tricky. A clever respondent may also think that his/her reported
response can be traced back to his/her actual status if he/she does not understand
the mathematical logic behind the randomization device. Some of the alternatives
to the RR technique include the Item Count Technique (Droitcour, Caspar, Hub-
bard, Parsley, Visscher   Ezzati 1991), the Three card method (Droitcour, Larson
& Scheuren 2001), and the Nominative technique (Miller 1985). These alternatives
are designed because, in general, respondent evade sensitive questions especially
regarding personal issues, socially deviant behaviors or illegal acts. Chaudhuri &
Christofides (2007) also added that in these three alternatives to RRT respondents
know that what they are revealing about themselves and they do not need to know

about any special estimation technique. Also respondents provide answers which
make sense to them.


2. Item Count Techniques
    In order to estimate the proportion of people with a stigmatizing attribute a
promising indirect questioning technique called Item Count Technique (ICT), was
introduced by Droitcour et al. (1991). It consists of taking two subsamples of sizes
n1 and n2 . The ith respondent in the first subsample is given a list of g innocuous
items and asked to report the number, say Xi of items that are applicable to
them (Xi ≤ g). Similarly, the jth respondent in the second subsample is provided
another list of (g + 1) items including the sensitive item and asked to report a
number, say Yj of the items that are applicable to them (Yj ≤ g + 1). The g
innocuous items may or may not be the same in both subsamples. An unbiased
estimator of the proportion of sensitive item in the population say π is given by:

                                   bI = Y − X
                                   π                                               (1)

where Y and X represent the sample mean from the second and first subsamples,
respectively.
    To our knowledge, no author has given the variance expression of the estimator
given in (1). We have derived the variance of the estimator in (1), and it is given
by:
                                                       !        g
                                     g           g
                                                               P
                                    P           P          n       θj θk
                                  n     θj 1 −      θj       j,k=1
                      π (1 − π)     j=1         j=1          j6=k
               πI ) =
            V (b                +                        +                      (2)
                          n2              n1 n2                n1 n2
where θj is the known proportion of the item j in the population. More details
about ICT can be found in Droitcour et al. (1991) and Droitcour   Larson (2002).
Dalton, Wimbush   Daily (1994) named ICT as the unmatched count technique
and applied it to study the illicit behaviors of the auctioneers, and as compared
to the direct questioning they obtained higher estimates of six stigmatized items.
Wimbush   Dalton (1997) applied this technique in estimating the employee theft
rate in high-theft-exposure business and found higher theft rates. Tsuchiya (2005)
extended the ICT to domain estimators by the stratified method, the cross-based
method, and the double cross-based method. More recently, Tsuchiya, Hirai &
Ono (2007) studied the properties of the ICT through an experimental web survey
and found that ICT yielded higher estimates of the proportions of the shoplifters
by nearly 10% as that of yielded by direct questioning. They also found that the
cross-based method was the most appropriate one.
    Besides its fruitful applications ICT has not been found fruitful in many stud-
ies; for example, Droitcour et al. (1991), Biemer   Wright (2004) and Ahart &
Sackett (2004) failed to get higher estimates in their studies of different stigma-
tized traits. We have focused on the issue of the need of two subsamples in the
usual application of ICT and have proposed an alternative ICT which does not

need two subsamples. Avoiding the need of two subsamples for our proposed ICT
makes it more attractive in terms of cost and statistical efficiency. The following
section provides a description of the proposed methodology.


2.1. Proposed Item Count Technique
    Each respondent in a sample of size n is provided a questionnaire (list of
questions) consisting of g (≥ 2) questions. The jth question consists of queries
about an unrelated item (Fj ), and a sensitive characteristic (S). The respondent
is requested to count 1 if he/she possesses at least one of the characteristics Fj
and S, otherwise, count 0, as a response to the jth question, and to report the
total count based on entire questionnaire.
    The list of items is given to the respondents and they are sent to another room
so that they are unseen to the interviewer. To illustrate, suppose the sensitive
study item (S) be the cheating in exams and the unrelated items (Fj , j = 1, 2.)
are: (i) “Do you live in the hostel?” and (ii) “Is the last digit of your registration
number odd?” It is obvious that there are almost (if not exactly) 50% (known)
of the students having an odd registration number and proportion of the students
living in hostel is easily available from the warden office. Let Zi denote the total
count of ith respondent, and then mathematically we can write it as:
                                              g
                                              X
                                       Zi =         αj                                (3)
                                              j=1


where αj can assume values “1” and “0” with probabilities (π + θj − πθj ) and
(1 − π − θj + πθj ), respectively.
     Taking expectation on (3) we have:
                                g
                                X                        g
                                                         X              g
                                                                        X
                  E (Zi )   =         E (αj ) = gπ +           θj − π         θj
                                j=1                      j=1            j=1
                                               
                                        g
                                        X                g
                                                         X
                            = g −            θj  π +         θj
                                        j=1              j=1


     This suggests defining an unbiased estimator of π as:
                                                Pg
                                         Z−              θj
                                 π
                                 bP =           Pgj=1                                 (4)
                                          g−        j=1 θj


    The estimator given in (4) serves the purpose of estimating π as is done by π
                                                                                bI
in (1). The estimator πbP obtained through our proposed ICT does not demand
two subsamples which are needed by π   bI based on the usual ICT. This property
(avoiding the need of two subsamples) makes our proposal more attractive and
practicable.

     Some comments are in order. It is to be noted that in some surveys it may
be possible to have unrelated traits (Fj , j = 1, 2, . . . , g) with equal proportions
(θj , j = 1, 2, . . . , g). In these situations we have θj = g1 for all j and consequently
the variance of the proposed estimator π        bP reduces to
                                       π (1 − π)    (1 − π)
                              πP ) =
                           V (b                  +                                    (6)
                                           n       ng (g − 1)

    As pointed by the two referees, it is just possible that the actual status of the
respondents about one (or all) the unrelated item(s) may be known to the inter-
viewer by any means, then the response of 0 or g would disclose his/her status
about the sensitive item. In this case privacy protection provided to the respon-
dents will be limited. Thus, the unrelated items should be chosen in such a way
that the actual status of the respondents about at least one of the unrelated items
must be impossible to know by any means. To fix the idea, suppose the unrelated
items are (i) and (ii) as we discussed above, then knowing the residential status of
a particular student is difficult while actually conducting the survey but the pro-
portion of students living in hostel may be readily available from the warden office.
Similar is the case with the unrelated item of registration number. If it is possible
to exactly guess or know about the particular item(s) for a given individual then
such item(s) must not be included in the group of items. In this way, respondents
would feel more protected and be motivated to answer truthfully. And, of course,
the interviewer’s ethical responsibility of being honest is more apparent, in the
sense that he would be asking about those items about which he knows nothing of
a particular respondent. The item count technique surveys are conducted in the
hope that the respondents will be motivated more to reveal truthful answers rather
than trapping them in mathematical tricks to trace their actual responses on the
sensitive items. It will essentially be a direct questioning situation if surveyor is
able to know the status of each respondent on each unrelated item. So, respondents
must be assured that it is impossible to know the status of individual about an
item but, of course, its population proportion is known somehow. It is easy to un-
derstand now that knowing the population proportion of an unrelated item is not
harmful but knowing the individuals’ status is. Moreover, another characteristic
of such indirect survey methods is the anonymity. The identity (in terms of name
or registration number, etc.) of the respondent is not required. The respondents
may just write their answers on a sheet of paper and drop them in a box making it
impossible to know the response of a particular respondent even the interviewer is
able to know the status of a particular respondent on a given item. For example,


                                         Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 39–54

44                                            Zawar Hussain, Ejaz Ali Shah   Javid Shabbir


in our situation, if the surveyor is able enough to guess or know the residential
status (hostelite or non-hostelite) of a student, due to anonymity, he/she is not
able to know reported response of a given respondent. Thus, any unrelated item
whose population proportion is known may be used in this technique.
    The acceptance of the unrelated question by the respondents, as pointed by
the two learned referees, is another key issue of concern. In some cases, it would
be needed to explain the working of whole the technique to the respondents. But
it depends on the nature and composition of the population. In such cases survey
must be conducted under the supervision of a trained statistician. More specifi-
cally, if the studied population is composed of illiterate individuals the technique
must be explained to them prior to actually conducting the survey. The explana-
tion of the technique would possibly decrease the suspicion among the respondents
of being tricked. Further, the suspicion depends upon the anonymity provided by
the survey method. If the respondents are explained about the working of the sur-
vey in such a way that their anonymity is assured and they are giving meaningful
answers in the sense that only population proportion of study item is estimated
and individual’s status can not be known through their reported response. With
this explanation and provision of anonymity it is anticipated that any unrelated
item with known population proportion of prevalence may be fairly used. One
more thing about the acceptance of unrelated items by the respondents is the
simplicity of the question. The unrelated question must not be an open ended or
having multiple answers, that is, it must be a binary item.



3. Performance Evaluations and Comparison
    In this section, we provide efficiency comparisons of the estimator π
                                                                        bP of the
proposed ICT with the π  bI of the usual ICT and another obtained through RRT
of Warner (1965). As we have discussed, that ICT has been developed as an
alternative to RRT, so we have also compared our technique with RR technique
proposed by Warner (1965).


3.1. Proposed versus Usual ICT

   We compare the proposed estimator π   bP with the usual ICT estimator π   bI in
both the situations of having and not having unequal θj = g1 . In case of having
unequal θj0 s the proposed estimator π
                                     bP would be more efficient than the estimator

which is always true for every value of g (≥ 2) (i.e., the number of innocuous

3.2. Proposed versus Warner’s RRT
    To have an efficiency comparison, we first give a short description of Warner
(1965) RRT. Warner (1965) introduced this method to decrease the biasedness in
the estimators and to increase the response rate. Warner’s technique consists of
two complimentary questions A (Do you belong to the sensitive group?) and Ac
(Do you not belong to the sensitive group?) to be answered on a probability basis.
Assuming a simple random sampling with replacement (SRSWR), the ith selected
respondent is asked to select a question (A or Ac ) and report “yes” if his/her actual
status matches with selected question, and “no” otherwise. Assuming that p is the
probability of selecting question A, and π is the population proportion of indi-
viduals with sensitive group, the probability of “yes” for a particular respondent,
denoted by θ, is given by:

                           P (yes) = θ = pπ + (1 − p) (1 − π)                         (8)

   From (8), we have
                                         θ − (1 − p)
                                    π=                                                (9)

   An unbiased estimator of π, by the methods of moment and maximum likeli-
hood estimation, is given as:

                                                 θb − (1 − p)
                                        bW =
                                        π                                                        (10)

               0
where θb = nn and n0 is the number of “yes” responses in the sample of size n.
     The variance of the estimator π
                                   bW is given by:

                                             π (1 − π)    p (1 − p)
                                    πW ) =

    We have calculated the Relative Efficiency (RE ) of the proposed estimator
π
bP relative to π bI when it is difficult/impossible to have θj = g1 , and results are
provided in Tables 1–9. The RE of the proposed estimator π    bP relative to πbW for
θj 6= g1 is presented in Tables 10–12. For θj = g1 the RE of π bP relative to πbW is
arranged in Table 13.

   From the above tables 1–13 it is advocated that
                         Pg
  1. For larger values of j=1 θj the proposed estimator π
                                                        bP is less efficient than
     bI when g and πare smaller, but when g increases it becomes more efficient
     π
     even for smaller values of π.
                            Pg
  2. For smaller values of j=1 θj the proposed estimator π bP is more efficient
     than πbI even when g and πare smaller.
  3. n, n1 and n2 do not have a significant effect on the
                                                        PRE   of the proposed
                                                          g
                           bI except the case when n and j=1 θj are larger and
     estimator relative to π
     g = 2.
            Pg
  4. When j=1 θj = 1 the proposed estimator is always more efficient.
                                                                 bW but as g and
  5. For smaller p the proposed estimator is less efficient than π
     π are increased the RE of the proposed estimator is increased.
            Pg
  6. When j=1 θj is smaller the proposed estimator is more efficient than π  bW
     when π > 0.1 and g > 2.
  7. Compared to πbW proposed estimator π                             bW for g > 3
                                            bP is more efficient than π
     under the given condition of θj = g1 .

  8. The RE of the proposed estimator π     bP relative to π
                                                           bW increases with an
     increase in p for a given value of g and πand it increases, for a given value
     of p, if g increases.

   In the application scenario all the disciplines which are of sensitive nature and
need extreme care in taking responses may take benefit out of the proposal, e.g.,
having more concern on time sensitivity (cf. Bonetti, Waeckerlin, Schuepfer &
Frutiger 2000).

4. Concluding Remarks
    An alternative item count technique has been presented in this article. One
of the main features of this technique is that it does not require the selection of
two subsamples of sizes n1 and n2 . Therefore, we do not need to worry about
the optimum values of n1 and n2 (as is the case with usual ICT estimator π     bI ).
Furthermore, the response from a respondent is bounded to lie between 0 and g,
which helps to provide the privacy to the respondent because the response can
not be traced back to respondent’s actual status about the possession of sensitive
item (provided that the actual status of a particular respondent about at least one
unrelated characteristic is unknown to the interviewer or anonymity is provided
to respondents). To avoid this situation, we recommend conducting the survey in
the absence of the interviewer or the whole process must be administered unseen
to the interviewer.

    It has been observed that the proposed item count technique estimator per-
forms better than the usual item count technique under the conditions that θj = g1
     Pg
and j=1 θj = 1. It may be difficult to select the items in such a way that their
proportions in the population are the same and sum to one, but this would be
the case if the number of items is large. Thus, in practice, one or two innocuous
items with same proportions can be found and included in the item list (e.g., item
1: Were you born in the months from January to June?, and Item 2: Is your
gender male?) If the condition to satisfy the inequality (7) is hard to meet we
would suggest to look for a large number of innocuous items (4, 5, 6, etc.) such
that
Pg their prevalence in the population is rare and consequently we have smaller
   j=1 θj , so that inequality (7) is easily satisfied.

    In brief, based on the findings of the Section 4 and the concluding discussion
above we recommend the use of the proposed ICT in surveys about sensitive items
instead of the usual ICT and the Warner’s RRT. Preferably, the data collecting
phase must be administered unseen to the surveyor.
