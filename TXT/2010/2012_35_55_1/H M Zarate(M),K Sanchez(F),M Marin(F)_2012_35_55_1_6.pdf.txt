Quantification of Ordinal Surveys and Rational Testing: An Application to the Colombian Monthly Survey of Economic Expectations
Universidad Nacional de Colombia
Abstract
Expectations and perceptions obtained in surveys play an important role in designing the monetary policy. In this paper we construct continuous variables from the qualitative responses of the Colombian Economic Expectation Survey (EES). This survey examines the perceptions and expectations on different economic variables. We use the methods of quantification known as balance statistics, the Carlson-Parkin method, and a proposal developed by the Analysis Quantitative Regional (AQR) group of the University of Barcelona. Then, we later prove the predictive ability of these methods and reveal that the best method to use is the AQR. Once the quantification is made, we confirm the rationality of the expectations by testing four key hypotheses: unbiasedness, no autocorrelation, efficiency and orthogonality.
Key words: Rational Expectations, Survey, Quantification.
Resumen
En este artículo se cuantifican las respuestas cualitativas de la “Encuesta Mensual de Expectativas Económicas (EMEE)” a través de métodos de conversión tradicionales como la estadística del balance de Batchelor, el método probabilístico propuesto por Carlson-Parkin (CP) y la propuesta del grupo de Análisis Cuantitativo Regional (ACR) de la Universidad de Barcelona. Para las respuestas analizadas de esta encuesta se encontró que el método ACR registra el mejor desempeño teniendo en cuenta su mejor capacidad predictiva. Estas cuantificaciones son posteriormente utilizadas en pruebas de racionalidad de expectativas que requieren la verificación de cuatro hipótesis fundamentales: insesgamiento, correlación serial, eficiencia y ortogonalidad.
Palabras clave: cuantificación, encuestas, expectativas racionales.
 
1. Introduction
   Economic decisions are usually made under a scenario of uncertainty about
economic conditions. Thus, expectations on key variables and how private agents
form their expectations play a crucial role in macroeconomic analysis. The direct
way in the measurement of expectations comes from the application of qualitative
surveys1 of firms, which try to gauge respondent’s perceptions regarding current
economic conditions and expected future activity. According to Pesaran (1997),
the “Business Surveys” provide the only opportunity to explore one of the big
black boxes in the economy that inquire about the expectations and which allows
to obtain leading indicators of current changes in economic variables over the
business cycle.
    The main characteristic of this kind of surveys is that questions provide ordinal
answers that reveal the direction of change for the variable under consideration2. In
other words it increases, remains constant or declines. The information extracted
with ordinal data is used to anticipate the behavior of economic variables of con-
tinuous type and to build indicators of economic activity3 . However, the analysis
requires a cardinal unit of measurement and therefore a conversion method from
nominal to quantitative figures is a topic in business analysis.
    In this paper we study the properties of several methodologies to quantify
the qualitative answers and present an application from the monthly Economic
Expectation Survey (EES) realized by the central bank of Colombia during the
period October 2005 to January 2010. The article is organized into six sections
including this introduction. In Section 2, briefly we describe traditional methods
to convert variables from qualitative to continuous type. Later, in Section 3 we
present the application of these methods with some of the questions contained in
the EES. The models for expectations and the econometric strategy for testing are
summarized in the Section 4. Section 5 shows the empirical results. Finally, in
Section 6 we summarize the conclusions.


2. Quantification Methods of Expectations
   In order to measure the attitudes of the respondents for variables such as prices,
the central bank distributes monthly a questionnaire that can be classified into
four broad categories: past business conditions, outlook of the business activity,
pressures on firm’s production capacity, outlook of wages and prices.
   The EES survey answers contains three options classified as follows: “increases”,
“decreases” or “remains the same”. In Table 1 is described the notation of the
answers of the public-opinion poll in terms of judgments (perception in the period t
   1 The impact of the expectations of the agents on the economic variables is difficult to observe

due to the fact that these are evaluated by quantitative measurements that present problems of
sensitivity: Sampling errors, sampling plan and measurement errors.
   2 Berk (1999), Visco (1984) among others, analyzed opinion surveys with more than three

categories of response.
   3 The evolution of cyclical movements is called the Business Climate indicator.

of the evolution of variable respect of the period t−1) and expectations (perception
in t of the evolution expected from the variable for t + 1)4 . In this case, JU Pt +
JDOt + JEQt = 1 if they are judgments, or EU Pt + EDOt + EEQt = 1 if they
are expectations.

    In this article, the expectations for growth in sales volume, the variation of
the total raw material prices (national and imported) and the variation in price
of products that will be sold; are quantified. The quantification techniques are
based on two concepts. The first concerns with the distribution of expectations in
which it is assumed that in the period t every individual i forms a distribution of
subjective probability distribution fit (µit , τit2 ) with mean µit and variance τit2 . The
mean of this can be distributed through individuals as: µit gt (µt , σt2 ) (where the
expected value µt measures the average expectations in the survey population at
time t and σt measures the dispersion of average expectations in that population);
the second assumes that an individual with probability distribution fit answers
“increases” or “decreases” to the questions of the survey, according to whether the
average subjective µit exceeds some rate limit δit or it is less to another rate limit
−ǫit respectively, so that δit > 0 and ǫit > 0.


2.1. The Balance Statistics
   Originally, this kind of statistics was introduced by Anderson (1952) in his
work for the IFO survey. This statistic is obtained by:

                                  Stt+1 = EU Pt − EDOt                                      (1)

   The advantage of this statistic is that it can be used both for questions that
investigate on judgments (Stt−1 ), and for making reference on expectations (Stt+1 ).
Batchelor (1986) takes into account the key concepts of the general theory of
quantification based on the following assumptions:

   •The distribution of expectations follows a sign function (Pfanzagl 1952, Theil
1958), with a time-invariant parameter θ. It is to say gt (µt , σt2 ) = g(µt , σt2 ), where:

     EDOt        si µit = −θ;        EEQt        si µit = 0;            EU Pt   si µit = θ   (2)

    •The distribution of the expectation is characterized by long terms unbiased,
which means that in a period of time with T surveys, the average expectation µt
is equal to the current average rate variable:
                                        T
                                        X               T
                                                        X
                                               µt =           xt                             (3)
                                         t=1            t=1


   •The function of the response limits δit and ǫit ; may be asymmetric and vary
over the individuals and time, but must be strictly less than θ; it is to say:

                                       δit < θ,         ǫit < θ                              (4)

      Therefore, the expected value and the variance of the distribution are:

     µit = θ(EU Pt − EDOt ),         σt2 = θ2 [(EU Pt + EDOt ) − (EU Pt − EDOt )2 ]          (5)

   By assuming the response function, the proportions of the sample:EU Pt , EDOt
and EEQt behave like maximum likelihood estimators, making it possible to es-
timate the parameter θ. With this estimate, it is obtained that

                   θ(EU Pt − EDOt ) =            xt ,                    PT
             t=1                           t=1                              t=1 xt
                                                              θb = PT                        (6)
                 T
                 X                         T
                                           X                        t=1 (EU Pt − EDOt
             θ         (EU Pt − EDOt ) =         xt ,
                 t=1                       t=1

      Fluri   Spoerndli (1987) estimate the expectation of the variable as:

                                           b
                                 (E(X))t = θ(EU Pt − EDOt )                                  (7)

    Where E(X) denotes the expectation of the random studied variable, xt is the
                                             b is the scaling factor determined by
realization of the variable under study and (θ)
the unbiasedness of the equation . Thus, the Modified Balance Statistical (MBS)
provides a measure of the expected average in the variable, taking into account
the trend and the points of inflection.

2.1.1. Recent Proposals

    Loffler (1999) estimates the measurement error introduced by the probabilis-
tic and proposes a linear correction method5 . On his part, Mitchell (2002) finds
     5 Claveria   Suriñach (2006).




                                            Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 77–108

evidence that the normal distribution, as well as any other stable distribution,
provides accurate expectations6 . Claveria   Suriñach (2006) posed different sta-
tistical expectations for the quantifications, including a method that proposes the
use of random walks and another one that use Markov processes of first order.
   Claveria (2010) proposes a statistical balance with nonlinear variation, called
                                          t −Ft
Weighted Balance, such that W Bt = R               Bt
                                        Rt +Ft = 1−Ct . This statistic takes into
account the percentage of respondents expecting no change in the evolution of an
economic variable.


2.2. Probabilistic Method
    This method was proposed originally for Theil (1952), initially applied by
Knobl (1974), and identified by Carlson   Parkin (1975) as CP “Probabilistic
Method”. For these authors, xit represents the percentage of change of a random
variable Xi of period t − 1 for the period t (with t = 2, 3, . . . , T ); the respondent
is indexed by i and xeit symbolizes the expectation having i on the change in Xi
from the period t to the period t + 1 (with t = 1, 2, . . . , T − 1). Also, they assume
intuitively that respondents have a range of indifference (ait , bit ), with ait < 0
and bit > 0, so that each one of the respondent answers “Decrease” if xeit < ait or
“Increase” if xeit > bit . If there is not change, xeit ∈ (ait , bit ).
    Thus, in the period t each respondent based his answers on a subjective prob-
ability distribution fi (xit /It−1 ) defined as from future change in Xi conditioned
by information available at the time t − 1 (represented by It−1 ). These subjective
probability distributions fi (·) are such that they can be used to obtain a proba-
                                                            S −1
bility distribution of added g(xi /Ωt−1 ), where Ωt−1 = N    i=1 It−1 is the union of
individual information groups (where Nt is the total number of respondents in the
period t)7 . For the estimation of xet , (“Average expectation of respondents”), the
                PN
equation xet = i=1 wi xeit , is used where wi represents the weight of the respondent
i and xeit represents the individual expectations.
    Carlson and Parkin make two additional assumptions: First, that the indiffer-
ence interval is equal for all respondents (ait = at y bit = bt ). Second fi (xit /It−1 )
has the same form for all players and the first and second moment are finite.
Thus, xeit may be considered as independent samples of an aggregate distribution
g(·) with mean E(xt /Ωt−1 ) = xet and variance σt2 , that can be written as8 :

             EDOt = prob{xt ≤ at /Ωt−1 },         EU Pt = prob{xt ≥ bt /Ωt−1 }              (8)

where each agent has the same subjective distribution of expectations based on
the information available. In most applications the use of the normal distribution
that is statistically appropriate, is completely specified by two parameters. Thus,
if G is defined as the cumulative distribution of the aggregate distribution g(·);
   6 Ibíd.
   7 Which is constant for each period.
   8 Note that if individual distributions are independent through respondents, they have a com-

mon and finite first and second time, then by the Central Limit Theorem g(·), they have normal
distribution.

it is obtained by standardizing ft and rt as the abscissa of the inverse of the G
corresponding to EDOt and (1 − EU Pt ). That is:
      ft = G−1 (EDOt ) = (at − xet )/σt ,       rt = G−1 (1 − EU Pt ) = (bt − xet )/σt    (9)

   Solving the system of Equation 9 to find the average expectations xet and the
dispersion σt , we obtain:
                                   bt ft − at rt               b t − at
                           xet =                 ,    σt = −                             (10)
                                      ft − rt                  ft − rt
   Carlson and Parkin assume that the indifference interval does not vary over
time, remaining fixed between business, and is symmetric around zero; that is,
−at = bt = c. Given this, we obtain an expression for calculating operational xet
by the method of Carlson and Parkin (CP), defined as:

                                                     ft + rt
                                       xet,cp = c                                        (11)
                                                     ft − rt
              P
                  x
with c = Pt dtt and dt = fftt +r−rt , where xt includes the annual variation of the
                                  t
              t
observed variable. In this case, the role of c is scaled xet , so that the average
value of xt equals xet , which means that expectations are assumed to be average
unbiased. Assuming that the random variable observed X has normal distribution,
then ft and rt are found using the inverse of the cumulative distribution standard
normal distribution, in the Equation 9. It is important to note that the imposition
of expectations makes them unsuitable to apply rationality contrasts a posteriori.
Moreover, it is assumed that fi (·) has normal distribution. However, the uniform
distribution also can be used. Assuming that X is distributed uniformly over the
interval [0, 1], then ft and rt are calculated as:
                         √              1          √   1
                    ft = 12(EDOt − ), rt = 12( − EU Pt )                       (12)

2.2.1. Disadvantages and Extensions of the Carlson-Parkin Method

    There are several shortcomings related to the Carlson-Parkin method. The
same answers for all the respondents cause that the statistic goes to infinity, which,
in turn, impedes the computation of expectations. Moreover, the assumption of
constant and symmetric limits through time means that respondents are equally
sensitive to an expected rise or an expected fall, of the variable under study. Seitz
(1988) relaxes the assumptions of the Carlson-Parkin method allowing time variant
boundaries of the indifference interval9 .


2.3. Regional Quantitative Analysis (RQA) Method
    This method was implemented by Pons and Claveria at the Regional Quanti-
tative Analysis Group (RQA); Department of Econometrics; Statistics and Eco-
nomics at the University of Barcelona (Claveria, Pons   Suriñach 2003). The
     9 See Nardo (2003).




                                            Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 77–108

estimation is performed in two stages. The first stage gives a first set of expec-
tations of the variation of the variable referred to as input, which can be defined
as:
                                    xeinput,t = b
                                                c ∗ dt                               (13)

where bc = |xt−1 |, dt = fftt −r
                              +rt
                                 t
                                   and xt−1 shows the growth rate of the reference quan-
titative indicator of the previous period. The parameter estimation of indifference
has a dual function: Firstly, it avoids the imposition of unbiasedness that occurs
when estimating the range of indifference by the CP method, thus, the estimation
allows movement in the indifference interval boundaries to incorporate changes
in response time, and secondly, it relaxes the assumption of constancy over time
of the scaling parameter because the parameter c will correspond to the rate of
variation of quantitative indicator in the reference period t − 1.
    The re-scaling of the series Input obtained from Equation 13 is necessary, be-
cause the function of c is the scalar statistic dt and, therefore, would be distorting
the interpretation given by the over-dimension of the class EEQt , that requires
less commitment from the respondent, and just distorting the interpretation that
is the parameter c as the limit of visibility. This justifies the need for scaling in
two stages.
    In the second stage the model is re-scaled with parameters changing over time.
This regression equation estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and the pa-
rameters obtained are used to estimate the new set of expectations, where the
series Input acts as an exogenous variable:

                                 xt = α + βxeinput,t + ut                            (14)

where α y β are the parameters of the estimation and ut is the error. On the
OLS, estimation of the regression parameters is constructed following conversion
equation:

           xet = α   b e
                 b + βx            donde   xeinput,t = b
                                                       c ∗ dt   y b
                                                                  c = |xt−1 |        (15)
                       input,t


where αb and βb parameters are estimated and xet represents the number of estimated
expectations of the rate of variation of the observed variable. Obtaining these set
of directly observed expectations allows us to contrast some of the hypotheses
usually assumed in economic models, such as the rationality of the agents.



3. Application to the EES
    In this section we apply the methods of quantification submitted to the ob-
served variables (EES); therefore expectations obtained are evaluated in terms of
their predictive ability. This is evaluated under four statistics known as Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute of the Percentage Error (MAPE), Root

   For the quantification of this question the indicator of annual variation Total
Index Sales10 , obtained from DANE is used as a reference. The methods applied
were: RQA with normal and uniform distribution, method of CP with normal and
uniform distribution and MBS.
   It is noted that the expectations generated by normal RQA and the uniform
method have very similar behaviors, and the patterns tend to have more movement
when compared with other methods. Similarly, one can see that the series of
expectations with the CP method with standard normal and uniform distribution,
have similar behavior.
    The results of the evaluation of the predictive power are presented in Table 2,
and they suggest that the most appropriate method to carry out this quantification
is the RQA with normal distribution, followed by the uniform distribution. In third

    The indicator used as reference is the annual variation Producer Price In-
dex, obtained from the natinal statistical office in Colombia DANE. The series
of expectations are estimated with the method of RQA with normal and uniform
distributions and they exhibit similar behaviors on oscillations recorded over time.
Moreover, the estimated normal uniform and CP and MBS fluctuate less than the
other series.
   The evaluation of the predictive ability (Table 3) indicates that the most ap-
propriate method is RQA with normal distribution, followed by the uniform distri-
bution. The third and fourth place corresponds to the CP method with uniform
and normal distribution, respectively. The least predictive method presented is
the MBS.

   The quantification is used as a reference indicator of annual variation rate of
the Producer Price Index Produced and Consumed (PPIP&C).
    It is noted that the expectations generated by the application of the method
of MBS have a pattern that turns smoothly around the mean. The expectations
series obtained with the CP method with normal and uniform distribution are
similar but with a greater degree of variability. The expectations series obtained
with the CP method with normal and uniform distribution are similar but with a
greater degree of variability.
    According to the statistics for the evaluation of the predictive ability (Table
4), the method with the best performance is the RQA with normal distribution,
followed by the uniform distribution. The third and fourth place corresponds to
the CP method uniform and the normal distributions respectively. Finally, the
MBS method is the least predictive.
    In general, there is evidence that the RQA methodology with standard normal
distribution, followed by the uniform distribution; they present the best results
in terms of evaluation of the predictive and their methods are attractive because
the indifference parameter is asymmetric, changing over time and staying unbi-
ased (which makes it optimal for the contrast of hypothesis about formation of
expectations).

    Nevertheless, due to the restriction of information on this method (both judg-
ments and expectations), it is suggested to consider the CP method and the
method of MBS in the quantification of the variables if you do not have all the
information available.

4. Modeling the Expectations
4.1. Extrapolative and Adaptative Expectations
    The pure model of extrapolative expectations is based on the assumption that
the expectations depend only on the observed values of the variable that wil be
predicted11 , of the variable to predict (Ece 2001), so this model can be represented
as (Pesaran 1985):
                                             ∞
                                             X
                                 e
                              t xt+1 = α +         wj xt−j + ut+1                       (17)
                                             i=1

    where t xet+1 is the expectation of the variable formed in the period t, for the
period t + 1; xt−j (with j = 0, 1, 2, . . .) are the known data of the variable in
the period t; wj are the weights (fixed) given to each of the known values of
the variable, and ut+1 is the random error term that attempts to capture the
unobserved effects on the expectation.
    Expectations of the adaptive model imply that if the variable value and ex-
pectations differ from the period of studies, then a correction to the expectation
for the next period is made. However, if there is not difference, the expectation
for the next period will stay unchanged (Ece 2001). On the imposition of certain
restrictions to wj in equation 17 it is possible to find the models used to testing
adaptative expectations (this would support the hypothesis that such expectations
are a special case of extrapolative expectations; (Pesaran 1985)). Thus, the four
models used to represent the adaptive expectations are (Pesaran 1985, Ece 2001):

                              xet+1 − xet = w(xt − xet ) + ut+1                         (18)

                  xet+1 − xet = α0 (xt − xet ) + α0 (xt−1 − xet−1 ) + ut+1              (19)
    xet+1 − xet = β0 (xt − xet ) + β1 (xt−1 − xt−1 ) + β2 (xt−1 − xet−1 ) + ut+1        (20)
                 xet+1 = λ0 + λ1 xet + λ2 xet−1 + λ3 xt + λ4 xt−1 + ut+1                (21)

88                         Héctor Manuel Zárate, Katherine Sánchez   Margarita Marín

    Finally, to see if expectations are adaptive or extrapolative, it is necessary to
perform an analysis on the coefficient of determination and the individual and joint
significance level of the parameters. If all these indicators are significant, then it
confirms the presence of these expectations. These models may have problems of
serial correlation of errors and endogeneity, so it is necessary to apply appropriate
econometric corrections to obtain estimators on which statistical inference can be
made.


4.2. Rational Expectations
    The rational expectations model was originally proposed by Muth (1961) and
is based on the assumption that individuals (at least on average) use all available
and relevant information when they make their predictions on the future behavior
of the variable studied (Ece 2001). This can be expressed by:

                                    xet = E(xt /It−1 )                                (22)

    where xt represents the value of the variable in the period t; xet stands for the
expected value of the variable for the period t reported in (t−1) and It−1 symbolizes
the available and relevant information in (t − 1). The rational expectations must
satisfy four tests (Ece 2001) and (Da Silva 1998):

     1. Unbiasedness: For the regression xt = α + βxet + ut the hypothesis H0 : α =
        0; β = 1 cannot be rejected.

     2. Lack of serial correlations: E(ut ut−i ) = 0, ∀i 6= 0

     3. Efficiency: In the equation ut = β1 xt−1 + β2 xt−2 + · · · + βi xt−i , i > 0; the
        coefficients should not be significant.

     4. Orthogonality: For the regression xt = α+βxet +γIt−1 +ut where, γ represent
        the effect of the information on the variable, the hypothesis H0 : α = 0; β =
        1, γ = 0 cannot be rejected.

    Some authors argue that orthogonality hyphotesis contains the rest. There-
fore, is sufficient to prove the existence of this to demonstrate the rationality of
expectations (Da Silva 1998).


4.3. Endogeneity Problem and a Correction
    Quantitative data for the expectations were calculated from the variable ob-
served, which was also used for the tests of rationality. This may generate en-
dogeneity problems that lead to inconsistent estimators. Then, to the covariance
matrix, Hansen   Hodrick (1980) propose, that, given an equation:

                                    yt+k = βxt + ut,k                                 (23)

Quantification of Ordinal Survey and Rational Testing                                       89

where yt+k is a variable k steps-ahead; xt is a row vector of T ×p dimension (where
p is the number of parameters that may or may not include the intercept12 and
T is the number of observations) containing all the relevant information in the
period t and at least one of the variables is endogenous; β is a column vector of
p × 1 dimension and ut,k is the vector of residues, calculated by Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS). It is possible to make a correction to the covariance matrix Θ such
that:

5. Empirical Results
    We checked the four fundamental hypotheses of the rational expectations model
using estimates by OLS and the correction of the covariance matrix. The results
of these tests are found in the tables at the end.
    The variable in the question 2, corresponde to the year-on-year variation rate
of the total sales index (denoted by St ). In questions 9 and 11, we employ the year-
on-year variation of the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the year-on-year variation
  12 As was shown in the previous section, the unbiasedness and orthogonality tests include the

intercept. However, the efficiency test does not.

of the Producer Price Index – Producer and Consumer (PPI_P&C), nominated
in both cases as Pt . We denoted the lags of this variable as St−i (question 2) and
Pt−i (questions 9 and 11). The variable xet represents in the question 2 the sales
expectations, Ste , and in the questions 9 and 11 ask for the inflation expectations
in raw materials and in products to be sold (in both cases Pte ). For the efficiency
test we use as dependent variable the error term ut , which is equal to St − Ste
(question 2) and Pt − Pte (questions 9 and 11). We generated these errors from
the regression used in the unbiasedness test.
    In the orthogonality test we use the one period lagged dependent variable14 in
all the questions. For the question 2, we use as information variables the monthly
variation of two periods lagged Market Exchange Rate (M ERt−2 ), the year-on-
year variation of one period lagged PPI (P P It−1 )15 , and year-on-year variation of
the two periods lagged Manufacturing Industry Real Production Index (IP It−2 ).
In the questions 9 and 11 we employ as information variables the M ERt−2 and
the one period lagged Aggregated Monetary (M 3t−1 )16 .
    In the Hansen and Hodrick correction, we use as the yt+k variables Pt , St and
ut . As xt we use: for the unbiasedness test, Ste (question 2) and Pte (questions
9 y 11); for the efficiency test, St−i (question 2) and Pt−i (questions 9 and 11)
and for the orthogonality tests St−1 , P P It−1 , IP It−2 , M ERt−2 (question 2) and
Pt−1 , M ERt−2 and M 3t−1 (question 9 y 11). As ut,k variable we use the errors
generated for each of the OLS regressions of the rational test. Finally, k is equal
to 12, because in all the questions of the survey we ask about the behavior of the
variables in 12 months17 .


5.1. Results of the Rational Test for the question 2
5.1.1. Results by OLS

    Table 5 presents the results of the unbiasedness and serial correlation tests.
Only by methods MBS and uniform and normal CP we can reject the null hypoth-
esis of unbiasedness. In the hypothesis of serial correlation, the LM18 statistic
reveals that only in MBS there is evidence of serial correlation. Table 6 shows the
  14 For example see Ece (2001), Gramlich (1983), Keane   Runkle (1990), Mankiw   Wolfers

(2003), Pesaran (1985).
  15 This variables were used because they are indicators of domestic and foreign prices of the

products, which can affect sales expectations
  16 As reported by the Central Bank in its Inflation Report of September 2010 (Banco de la

República de Colombia 2010), these variables have shown a greater influence on the country’s
inflation level.

  18 Which tests the null hypothesis of existence of correlation between the errors of the regression

using a regression between the errors, as the dependent variable, and the variables of the equation
and the p times lagged errors, as independent variables. From this, the statistic LM = nR2 is
calculated, where n is the number of data in the regression of errors and R2 is the coefficient
of determination. This statistic approximates the Chi-square distribution with p degrees of
freedom. If this statistic is greater than the critical Chi-square, then it is possible to reject the
null hypothesis of no autocorrelation among the errors.

results of the efficiency test. In all cases there is a relationship between the error
term and St−3 . Additionally the errors in the uniform RQA show relations with
St−1 and the errors in normal RQA present relation with St−1 and St−2 .
    The results of the orthogonality tests using St−1 (Table 7), M ERt−2 (Table 8),
P P It−1 (Table 9), IP It−2 (Table 10), and all the variables (Table 11), indicates
that in the case of St−1 , for all of the data set is possible reject the null hypothesis.
For M ERt−2 is possible reject the null hypothesis by MBS and uniform and normal
CP. In the case of P P It−1 we cannot reject the orthogonality for uniform and
normal RQA. For IP It−2 is possible reject the null hypothesis by MBS and uniform
and normal CP. Finally, with all the variables we can reject the orthogonality for
all the data sets.


5.1.2. Results by OLS with the Hansen and Hodrick Correction

    Table 12 presents the results of the unbiasedness test with the correction of
Hansen and Hodrick. It is not possible to reject the existence of unbiasedness for
any of the data sets. The results of the efficiency tests (Table 13) show that there
is no evidence to reject this hypothesis in either case. The orthogonality test using
St−1 (Table 14), M ERt−2 (Table 15), P P It−1 (Table 16), IP It−2 (Table 17) and
all the variables (Table 18) shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis, for
any of the variables and data sets.
   We did not test for serial correlation, since this cannot be corrected by the
Hansen and Hodrick method. However, we can say that this test is also satisfied,
because it is a corollary of the orthogonality, which is fulfilled for all methods.
Therefore, by extension, the serial correlation must be satisfied19 .


5.2. Results of the Rational Test for the question 9
5.2.1. Results by OLS

   Table 19 presents the results of the unbiasedness test and serial correlation.
For none of the cases it is possible to reject the null hypothesis of unbiasedness.
The LM statistic shows that there is serial correlation for all data sets. Table 20
reports the results of the efficiency test. In all the cases there is a relation between
the errors and Pt−1 . For uniform and normal RQA there are also relation with
Pt−2 Finally, MB and uniform and normal CP present relation with Pt−8 .
    The results of the orthogonality test using Pt−1 (Table 21), M ERt−2 (Table
22), M 3t−1 (Table 23), and all the variables (Table 24) show that for Pt−1 we can-
not accept the hypothesis of orthogonality, for any of the data sets. For M ERt−2 ,
it is possible to reject the null hypothesis for MBS and normal and uniform CP.
In the case of M 3t−1 we can not reject the null hypothesis, for all the data sets.
Finally, with all the variables, it is possible to reject the orthogonality for all the
methods.
  19 This reason is used to justify the non-existence of serial correlation for the other two ques-

tions.

5.2.2. Results by OLS with the Hansen and Hodrick Correction

    In Table 25, we present the results of the unbiasedness test with the Hansen
and Hodrick correction. There is not evidence to reject this null hypothesis for any
model. The efficiency test (Table 26) shows that we can not reject this hypothesis.
The results of the orthogonality test with Pt−1 (Table 27), M ERt−2 (Table 28),
M 3t−1 (Table 29), and all the variables (Table 30) show that we cannot reject the
null hypothesis, for any of the data sets and variables.


5.3. Results of the Rational Test for the question 11
5.3.1. Results by OLS

   The Table 31 shows the results of the unbiasedness and serial correlation test.
Only for the case of MBS, we can reject the null hypothesis of unbiasedness. The
LM statistic shows that there is serial correlation for all data sets. Table 32
presents the results of the efficiency test. For all methods there is a relationship
between errors and Pt−1 . For normal and uniform RQA there is also a relationship
with Pt−2 .
    The results of the orthogonality test using Pt−1 (Table 33), M ERt−2 (Table
34), M 3t−1 (Table 35), and all the variables (Table 36) show that for the case of
Pt−1 we can reject the null hypothesis for all the data sets. In the case of M ERt−2
is possible to reject the null hypothesis for MBS and normal and uniform CP. In
the case of M 3t−1 we can not reject the null hypothesis for all the data sets.
Finally, with all the variables, it is possible to reject the orthogonality for all the
methods.


5.3.2. Results by OLS with the Hansen and Hodrick Correction

    In Table 37 we present the results of the unbiasedness test with the Hansen
and Hodrick correction. There is not evidence to reject this null hypothesis for any
model. The efficiency test (Table 38) shows that we cannot reject this hypothesis.
The results of the orthogonality test with Pt−1 (Table 39), M ERt−2 (Table 40),
M 3t−1 (Table 41), and all the variables (Table 42) show that we cannot reject the
null hypothesis, for any of the variables and data sets.


6. Conclusions and Recommendations
   In order to identify the employers expectation formation process, we quantified
the qualitative responses to questions on economic activity and prices in the Eco-
nomic Expectation Survey (EES), applied by the division of Economic Studies of
the central bank of Colombia, from October 2005 to January 2010. We used the
conversion methods of Modified Balance Statistical, Carlson-Parkin with standard
normal distribution and uniform distribution [0, 1] and the method proposed by

the Regional Quantitative Analysis Group (RQA) at the University of Barcelona
with standard normal distribution and uniform distribution [0, 1].
     The evaluation of the quantification methods was performed using four statis-
tics to analyze their predictability: mean absolute error (MAE), absolute percent-
age error of the median (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RESM) and Theil U
coefficient (TU1). According to the criteria above, for the four analyzed variables,
it was found that the method with the best predictability was the one proposed
by the RQA group with standard normal distribution, followed by the uniform
distribution [0, 1]. However, due to the restriction of information on this method,
it is suggested to take into account the methods of the MBS and CP, in the quan-
tification of the variables that do not have all available information.
    Subsequently, we confirmed the existence of rational expectations for three
questions of the EES. By applying the correction proposed by Hansen and Ho-
drick for the endogeneity problem, it was found that the unbiasedness, efficiency,
orthogonality and serial correlation tests were fulfilled for the three questions, con-
sidering the five methods of quantification. With these results we can conclude
that the business expectations of the variation in sales, prices of raw materials and
prices of domestic production in Colombia are compatible with the hypothesis of
rational expectations.
    However, this document was an initial approach to the quantification and ver-
ification of the rational expectations. Futher studies on the topic should explore
other methodologies Kalman filter or considering parameters that change over
time. Additionally, other papers can implement other econometric methods for
testing rationality hypotheses, such as maximum likelihood estimators or restricted
cointegration tests.
