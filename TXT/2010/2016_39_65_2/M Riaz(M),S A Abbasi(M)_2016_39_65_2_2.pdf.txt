Abstract
In monitoring process parameters, we assume normality of the quality characteristic of interest, which is an ideal assumption. In many practical situations, we may not know the distributional behavior of the data, and hence, the need arises use nonparametric techniques. In this study, a nonparametric double EWMA control chart, namely the NPDEWMA chart, is proposed to ensure efficient monitoring of the location parameter. The performance of the proposed chart is evaluated in terms of different run length properties, such as average, standard deviation and percentiles. The proposed scheme is compared with its recent existing counterparts, namely the nonparametric EWMA and the nonparametric CUSUM schemes. The performance measures used are the average run length (ARL), standard deviation of the run length (SDRL) and extra quadratic loss (EQL). We observed that the proposed chart outperforms the said existing schemes to detect shifts in the process mean level. We also provide an illustrative example for practical considerations.

Resumen
En el seguimiento de los parámetros del proceso, asumimos normalidad de la característica de calidad de interés que es un supuesto ideal. En muchas situaciones prácticas, no podemos conocer el comportamiento de distribución de los datos y por lo tanto, surge la necesidad de técnicas no paramétricas. En este estudio, un gráfico de control EWMA doble paramétrico, a saber, la carta NPDEWMA, se propone para una vigilancia eficaz en el parámetro de localización. El rendimiento del gráfico propuesto se evalúa en términos de propiedades diferentes de longitud de ejecución, como promedio, desviación estándar y percentiles. El esquema propuesto se compara con sus homólogos de los últimos existentes, a saber, la EWMA no paramétrico y los esquemas de CUSUM no paramétricas. Las medidas de desempeño utilizadas son la longitud promedio de carreras (ARL), la desviación estándar de la longitud de ejecución (SDRL) y pérdida cuadrática extra (EQL). Se observa que el gráfico propuesto supera a dichos regímenes existentes para detectar cambios en el proceso de nivel medio. También se proporciona un ejemplo ilustrativo para consideraciones prácticas.

1. Introduction
    Process monitoring plays an important role in improving quality of the final
output. Control charts are important statistical process monitoring tools that
help in differentiating un-natural variations from natural. The design structures
of control charts may be memory-less (cf. Shewhart, Shewhart 1931) or memory
(cf. CUSUM, Page 1954) and (cf. EWMA, Roberts 1959). The memory-less
control charts are meant for larger shifts while the others are meant for the shifts
of smaller magnitudes. The application of control charting techniques is not only
limited the to manufacturing industry but it covers a wide range of disciplines, such
as nuclear engineering (cf. Hwang, Lin, Liang, Yau, Yenn & Hsu 2008), health care
(cf. Woodall 2006), education (cf. Wang & Liang 2008) and analytical laboratories
(cf. Masson 2007, Abbasi 2010), among many others.
   There are different types of classifications of control charts, such as parametric
versus non-parametric, variable versus attributes, univariate versus multivariate
and bayesian versus classical. The parametric charting structures rely on the
assumption that the parent distribution of the quality characteristic of interest is
known (more specifically normally distributed in many cases). This assumption is
not very realistic as, in practice, one may not know the distributional form of the
quality characteristic of interest.
   This limitation restricts the use of parametric control charts for the monitoring
of process parameters. In these scenarios, the parametric charts may lead to
misleading results, and hence, we prefer to use the non-parametric control charts.
The relevant literature is written by Chakraborti & Graham (2007), Das (2009),
Qiu, Zou & Wang (2010), Human, Chakraborti & Smit (2010), Khilare & Shirke
(2010), and Pawar & Shirke (2010), Abbasi & Miller (2013) and the references
therein. The robust charting structures also provide a good alternative for non-
normal situations (cf. Stoumbos & Reynolds 2000, Stoumbos & Sullivan 2002, and
the references therein)
   There are different types of non-parametric Shewhart, EWMA and CUSUM
control charts. For an efficient detection of small shifts, nonparametric EWMA

(NPEWMA) and nonparametric CUSUM (NPCUSUM) control charts have also
been proposed in the literature. In reference to several of these; Li, Tang & Ng
(2010) proposed NPEWMA and NPCUSUM charts based on the Mann-Whitney
statistic; Zou & Tsung (2011) proposed a multivariate EWMA control chart using
the weighted version of the sign test; Graham, Chakraborti & Human 2011a, 2011b
proposed nonparametric EWMA sign and signed-rank control charts to monitor
the location parameter; Yang & Cheng (2011) proposed two NPEWMA control
charts, namely the nonparametric EWMA sign (NPSE ) chart and the nonpara-
metric Arcsine EWMA sign (NPASE ) chart; Yang & Cheng (2011) proposed a
nonparametric CUSUM (NPSC ) chart, using the sign statistics, for quick detec-
tion of shifts from the process target. Abbasi (2012) may also be seen in this
direction.
    The double EWMA (DEWMA) concept was investigated by Shamma &
Shamma (1992), Zhang & Chen (2005), and Khoo, Teh & Wu (2010) for a nor-
mally distributed quality characteristic of interest. Zhang, Govindaraju, Lai &
Bebbington (2003) also investigated the DEWMA chart for Poisson processes.
This study is aimed at proposing a new nonparametric DEWMA chart, namely
the NPDEWMA chart to efficiently monitor process location. The organization of
the rest of the article is given as follows: Section 2 describes the design structure
of the proposed NPDEWMA control chart. Section 3 evaluates the performance of
the proposed chart using different run length characteristics. Section 4 provides a
comparison of the NPDEWMA chart with recently proposed NPSE , NPASE and
NPSC charts. Section 5 presents an example to illustrate the application of the
proposed, and finally, the article ends with the concluding remarks in Section 6.



2. The Proposed Nonparametric Double EWMA
   (NPDEWMA) Chart
    This section provides the design structure of the proposed NPDEWMA control
chart to monitor the location parameter. Assume that X1 ,X2 ,. . . ,Xn represent a
random sample of size n from a process with the location parameter µ. Let us
define a transformed random variable Y as Yi = Xi -µ. Let p be a probability
measure defined as: p=pr(Yi >0). We assume that the process location is in-
control if p takes the value p0 and otherwise out-of-control for any other value.
We intend to control the location parameter by monitoring the stability of p with
reference to p0 .
     In order to do this, we introduce here an indicator variable I,as I = 1 if Yi > 0
and zero otherwise.
               Pn      Based on this indicator variable, Yang, Lin & Cheng (2011)
defined M = i=1 Ii , which follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and
p0 . The arcsine transformation for M and its approximate distribution is given as
                                   r                        
                              −1       M        −1 √       1
                      z = sin            ∼ N sin     p0 ,      .                       (1)

Based on the above mentioned variable, the exponentially weighted moving average
(EWMA) statistic is defined as:

                                    Wt = λZt + (1 − λ)Wt−1                                    (2)
                                                           √
where λ is a smoothing constant (0 < λ < 1), and W0 = sin−1 p0 .
      We define here another EWMA statistic for Wt as:

                           Dt = λWt + (1 − λ)Dt−1                                             (3)
                                       √
where λ is defined above and D0 = sin−1 p0 .
  We refer to this new statistic as the double EWMA (DEWMA) statistic. The
DEWMA statistic defined above may be expressed in an alternative from, as (cf.
Roberts 1959 and Montgomery 2009) have described

                                       t−1
                                       X
                           Dt = λ            (1 − λ)i Wt−i + (1 − λ)t D0                      (4)
                                       i=0

      By substitutions and further simplifications we have


             t−1
             X                   t−i−1
                                  X
   Dt = λ          (1 − λ)i (λ           (1 − λ)j Zt−i−j + (1 − λ)t−i W0 ) + (1 − λ)t D0      (5)
             i=0                 j=0


   For the DEWMA statistic Dt , the expressions for the mean and the variance
are respectively given as (cf. Zhang et al. 2003 and Zhang & Chen 2005)
                                              √
                                 µD = sin−1 p0 ,

   2
  σD = (λ4 /4n(1 − (1 − λ)2 )3 )(1 + (1 − λ)2 − (t + 1)2 (1 − λ)2t
                                             + (2t2 + 2t − 1)(1 − λ)2t+2 − t2 (1 − λ)2t+4 ) (6)

   Based on these quantities, the L-sigma limits for the proposed NPDEWMA
chart are defined as

              LCLD = µD − L ∗ σD                  and      U CLD = µD + L ∗ σD ,              (7)
where L is the control limits coefficient that helps in fixing the average run length
(ARL) for an in-control situation denoted by ARL0 . The values of L depend on the
choices of n, λ and ARL0 for the NPDEWMA control chart. The values of L are
worked out for different combinations of the aforementioned quantities. Figure 1
presents plots of ARL0 versus L for some representative values of n at λ = 0.05 for
ARL0 values ranging from 50 to 500. These plots help to choose the appropriate
control chart multiplier to fix the ARL0 for the NPDEWMA chart. The ARL0
plots versus L may be obtained on the similar lines for other choices of n, λ and
ARL0 .

Nonparametric Double EWMA Control Chart for Process Monitoring                       171

    By using the above mentioned structure of the control limits for the proposed
NPDEWMA chart, an out-of-control signal (if any) is detected when Dt plots
beyond the (LCL, UCL) limits. The NPDEWMA chart makes use of current as
well as the past information to efficiently monitor the location shits (particularly
of a smaller magnitude) that accumulate over time.


3. Performance Evaluations of the Proposed Chart
    This section provides the performance evaluations of the proposed NPDEWMA
chart to monitor the location parameter. The performance measures used in this
study are the average run length (ARL) and extra quadratic loss (EQL). The ARL
measure is defined as the average number of samples required before an out-of-
control signal is issued in the process. It is classified by two forms, namely ARL0
(when process is in-control) and ARL1 (when process is out-of-control). Also, it is
evaluated shift by shift (we will use δ to refer to the amount of shift in standard
deviation units). A good chart should have larger values for ARL0 and smaller
values for ARL1 . The other measure, namely EQL is evaluated over the whole
range of δ values (from the smallest (min) to the largest (max)). It is defined as
(see cf. Ahmad, Lin, Abbasi & Riaz 2012, 2013a, 2013b) and the references therein
for further details)
                                             Z δmin
                                    1
                      EQL =                          δ 2 ARL(δ)dδ                (8)
                               δmax − δmin δmax
where ARL(δ) is the average run length of a particular chart at δ. It is generally
desirable to have smaller values of EQL for an efficient charting structure.
    In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed NPDEWMA chart for dif-
ferent numbers of shifts, p = 0.5 is taken as the in-control value while p 6= 0.5 is the
out-of-control value. Moreover, by computing the EQL, we define δ as a deviation
of p from 0.5 (the in-control level) to some other value of p in standard devia-
tion units. In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation with 104 iterations is used for
the run length distribution of the proposed NPDEWMA chart with an acceptable
error rate (cf. Lucas & Saccucci 1990, Maravelakis, Panaretos & Psarakis 2005,
Abbasi 2010 and Abbasi & Miller 2013, Kim 2005 and Schaffer & Kim 2007). The
run length properties investigated in this study include ARL, standard deviation
of the run length (SDRL) and different quantile points (Qi = ith percentile point)
of the run length distribution. It should to be noted that Q0.50 refers to median
run length (MRL), which is also a useful run length measure.
    The summary of the run length properties (in-control and out-of-control) for
the proposed NPDEWMA chart is reported in the following form: ARL and SDRL
(along with the controlling coefficient L) (cf. Table 1), different percentiles (cf.
Table 2) and EQL (cf. Table 5) for some representative choices of n and at ARL0 =
370. For the other choices, the results can be obtained on similar lines. The relative
standard errors of the results reported in the above mentioned tables are observed
to be around 1.5%, and they are checked by repeating the simulations. This is
quite acceptable in control chart studies (cf. Kim 2005 and Schaffer & Kim 2007).

4. Comparative Analysis of the Results
    In this section we provide a comparative discussion of the results obtained in
Section 3 for the proposed NPDEWMA chart. Moreover, the efficiency of the
proposed chart is also compared with the recently proposed NPSE , NPASE and
NPSC charts in the literature. The summarized information of these charts, along
with the proposed NPDEWMA chart, is provided in Table 3. For the details of
these charting structures, see Yang et al. (2011), Yang & Cheng (2011) and Abbasi
(2012). We evaluate performance of these competing charts for some selective
values of n. The control charting parameters of different control charts (like K,
H, k, L) are set in such a way that the ARL0 value of all the charts is fixed at
370 for valid comparisons among different charts. The resulting ARL values for
the competing charts are provided in Table 4. The EQL values are also evaluated
for these competing charts on the same lines as the proposed NPDEWMA chart.
The results for all charts are provided in Table 5.

    For a comparative discussion of the different choices for the proposed NPDEW-
MA chart and the other competing charts, we have created some useful graphs for
different values of n and λ at ARL0 = 370. The similar graphs may be observed
for the other choices of the said quantities. These graphs are provided in Figures
2-5 where p is plotted on horizontal axis and the ARL on the vertical axis. They
are in logarithmic scale for better visual inspection.

   In terms of different measures, the performance evaluations of the proposed
and the other competing control charts, advocate the following:

i) the proposed NPDEWMA chart is easily implemented in practice for process
      monitoring as it simply involves the computation of the Dt statistic given
      in (4), and it is plotted it against the limits given in (7) (without relying on
      normality);
ii) the proposed NPDEWMA chart has the ability to efficiently detect smaller
      (for smaller choices of λ) as well as larger shifts (for larger choices of λ) (cf.
      Table 1 and Figures 2-3);
iii) the proposed structure is effective for both directions, i.e. increasing and
      decreasing shifts in the process parameter) (cf. Table 1 and Figures 2-3);

v) the NPDEWMA chart shows decreasing behavior of ARL, SDRL and the per-
     centile points with a decrease in the value of λ and an increase in the value
     of n and δ (cf. Tables 1-2 and Figures 2-3);

vi) the proposed NPDEWMA chart performs better than the competing counter-
     parts NPSE , NPASE and NPSC charts in terms of run length efficiency (cf.
     Tables 1 and 4 and Figures 4-5);

vii) the proposed NPDEWMA chart outperforms the other competing charts in
      terms of its overall performance measure EQL (cf. Table 5).

viii) The order and superiority (in terms of ARL and EQL measures) of the dif-
      ferent charts being researched in the study is: NPDEWMA, NPASE /NPSE
      and NPSC .

    As the run-length distribution is skewed to the right, many researchers recom-
mend examining a different number of percentiles including the 5th , 25th , median,
75th and 95th percentiles in order to better characterize the run-length distribu-
tion. Therefore, we have provided some additional measures for the proposed chart
(cf. Table 2). In addition, we have provided some useful properties of the proposed
scheme for smaller values of λ, including λ = 0.01, 0.025 and 0.10 (for n = 5) to
highlight the effectiveness of the proposal for smaller shifts. These results can be
seen in Table 6; they support the performance of the proposal for smaller and
smaller shift values.
    Moreover, motivated by Gan (1994), we have also set the design parameters by
fixing the MDRL value at a specific level, MDRL0 for example and have evaluated
the performance of the proposed scheme. The resulting performance measures
(with the desired nominal MDRL is equal to 350 i.e. MDRL0 = 350, in the form

of ARL, MDRL and SDRL) are provided in Table 7. This means that there is at
least a 50% chance that the first out-of-control signal will be observed by the 350th
sample despite the process actually being in-control. The results of Table 7 offer
attractive properties for the proposed chart by fixing the in-control run-lengths
to be greater than or equal to 350. These results are given for λ =0.01, 0.025
and 0.10 for n = 5. Similar results may be obtained for other choices of n,λ and
MDRL0 values.


5. Illustrative Example
    In this section, we provide an application of the proposed NPDEWMA chart
for a real data set to illustrate how it is implemented. The data set is based on an
important quality characteristic in a production process, namely the fill volume of
soft-drink beverage bottles (cf. Montgomery 2009, Yang et al. 2011 and Yang &
Cheng 2011). A coded scale is used to measure the volume by placing a gauge over
the crown and comparing the height of the liquid in the neck of the bottle. The
correct fill height is indicated by a reading of zero on this scale. The data consists
of fifteen samples of size n = 10 that are measured on the fill volume. Figure 6
represents the data in graph form.

    For the aforementioned data set, the charting statistic (Dt ) values of the pro-
posed NPDEWMA chart are computed using λ= 0.25. The control limits are set
such that ARL0 = 370 for which the control limits multiplier for the proposed
NPDEWMA chart L = 0.284 is used. The charting statistics are plotted against
these control limits. The same is done for the dataset under discussion, in the
three other competing control charts NPSE , NPASE and NPSC of this study. The
resulting control chart displays are shown in Figure 7 for all the four charts. We
observed that the proposed NPDEWMA chart gives six out-of-control signals for
the location parameter. The other charts show the out-of-control signals as: NPSE
three, NPASE one and NPSC none. This detection ability in the example data set
is in agreement with the dominance order that the previous section establishes.

6. Concluding Remarks
     This study has proposed a nonparametric double EWMA control chart for
efficiently monitor to the location parameter that has an unknown distributional
behavior. The design structure of the proposed NPDEWMA chart depends on
the sample size n and the smoothing constant λ. The controlling coefficients L
are worked out in irder to fix ARL0 at the prespecified level. Also, the control
limits are developed for the proposed chart to improve the monitoring of process
location when the parametric distribution of the quality characteristic of interest
is not known. The performance of the proposed chart is evaluated in terms of
different run length properties, including ARL, SDRL and some useful percentile
points. The EQL measure is also computed as an overall performance measure of
the proposed chart.
    Comparisons of the proposal were also carried out with some existing coun-
terparts, namely the NPSE , NPASE and NPSC charts that were proposed in the
literature. The comparisons revealed the superiority of the proposed NPDEWMA
chart over the competing counterparts in terms of improved run length properties.
For example, when p shifts to 0.55 at n = 5, λ = 0.05 and ARL0 = 370, the
ARL1 performance of the proposed NPDEWMA chart is 67.10. This is followed
by NPSE with ARL1 = 86.33, then NPASE with ARL1 = 90.98, and finally NPSC
with ARL1 = 94.90. For this particular change in p a gain of almost 22%, 26%
and 29% for the proposed NPDEWMA chart in comparison to NPSE , NPASE and
NPSC charts, respectively. The similar gains may be seen at other values of p for
different combinations of n and λ.
   The quality control practitioners may benefit from the proposal for better
detection of out-of-control signals during in the monitoring of process location

parameter. The scope of the study may be extended to double CUSUM charts.
Moreover, multivariate extensions of these charts to monitor the vector of loca-
tion parameters for more than one quality characteristics of interest is another
potential topic for future research.
