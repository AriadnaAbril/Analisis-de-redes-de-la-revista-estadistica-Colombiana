Abstract
The problem with designing balanced incomplete blocks (BIBD) is enclosed within the combinatorial optimization approach that has been extensively used in experimental design. The present proposal addresses this problem by using local search techniques known as Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, and an approach based considerable sized the use of Multi-Agents, which allows the exploration of diverse areas of search spaces. Furthermore, the use of a vector vision for the consideration associated with vicinity is presented. The experimental results prove the advantage of this technique compared to other proposals that are reported in the current literature.

1. Introduction
   According to Hinkelman & Kempthorne (1994), experimental designs are found
to be classified in hierarchic order, depending on the number of local control or
block factors. When the designs have parameters that lack precision, they are said
to be Random Blocks Designs, which, depending on some inherent properties,
can be identified as: Completely Randomized (CRB), Generalized Randomized
(GRB), and Incompletely Randomized (IRB). The last two are characterized be-
cause not all the treatments can be applied in each block. Within the field of
IRB, it is worth pointing out the design of Incomplete Balanced Blocks, which
were introduced by (Yates 1936). On many occasions, experiments might require
a reduction in the size of the blocks. The design of complete blocks can reduce
the estimated variance of the experimental error; however this reduction might be
insufficient because the number of treatments can be very large and the reduction
can result impractical.
    The design of incomplete blocks can avoid the complete replication of all the
experimental treatments. The designs of blocks in general, are arrangements de-
signed with the objective of having systematic control over the variability of the
data attributable to external sources and to separate, minimize and even eliminate
this variation from the rest of the effects of the factors of interest (Fisher 1926).
The design of incomplete blocks has r of t treatments in b blocks of k experi-
mental units with k < t. Raghavarao (1988), defines a BIBD as an arrangement
of v symbols and b groups in which each one of the k < v symbols must satisfy
the following conditions: i) Each group has exactly k different symbols, ii) each
symbol is present in exactly r groups, and iii) each pair of symbols are together
in exactly λ groups. The parameters of a BIBD must be positive whole integers
and can be identified as (v, b, r, k, λ), where v represents the number of blocks, b
the number of varieties in the design, r the number of replications in each variety,
k the number of different elements in each block, and λ the number of groups
in which each pair of symbols occur. This must satisfy the λ(v − 1) = r(k − 1)
relation. This kind of technique was initially applied in experimental design (van
Lint & Wilson 1992, Mead 1993): however, recently it has been applied in fields
such as cryptography (Buratti 1999), codification theory (Lan, Tai, Lin, Memari
& Honary 2008), sports league planning (Anderson 1997), and others.
    The development of block designs is enclosed within the NP-Hard type of prob-
lems (Corneil & Mathon 1978), and it provides an excellent reference point. This
is considering that it can scale and it has a wide variety of scenarios with countless
instances that can be ranked according to the degree of difficulty to generate a
solution. A complete number of algorithms have been applied to the problem,
which continues to be unsolvable, even for designs that are relatively small in size

A Multi-Agent Proposal for the Resolution of BIBD Instances                         269

(Gibbons & Ostergard 2007). This article approaches the BIBD problem from a
vector spaces stand point and the relationship these vectors have with each other
because of their separation angle. In addition a metaheuristic technique is em-
ployed based on local search (specifically Hill Climbing) providing a resolution
algorithm of great magnitude compared to other specialized algorithms found in
the current literature. The BIBD problem has been addressed in recent literature
by using a great number of different techniques. Some of the results obtained with
these techniques can be found in Colbourn & Dinitz (1996). Much of the previ-
ous research has addressed the problem from several points of view. Specifically
mathematical programming (Whitaker, Triggs & John 1990, John, Whitaker &
Triggs 1993), restriction programming (Flener, Frisch, Hnich, Kzltan, Miguel &
Walsh 2001, Puget 2002, Meseguer & Torras 2001). Regarding restriction pro-
gramming, it is convenient to mention that a point of interest for researchers has
been the symmetric property (permutation of rows and columns that can produce
the same results) present in the problem. In term of this problem, Puget (2002)
proposes a combination of methods to solve the problem through the rupture of
symmetries, while Meseguer & Torras (2001) explore two strategies (a heuristic
one for the selection of variables and a trimming procedure).
    Recent proposals have used heuristic techniques to resolve BIBD. For this rea-
son, the generation of the BIBD type designs was formulated by Bofill, Guimerà
& Torras (2003) as a combinatory optimization problem addressed at neural net-
works. The simulated annealing algorithm that is supplied with a neural net-
work (NN-SA) has proven to offer a better performance than the analogous hy-
bridizations with simulated annealing. These results were improved by Prestwich
(2003a, 2003b), using an local search algorithm in conjunction with the addition of
new restrictions that were a result of with the symmetric outline of the problem.
Rodriguez, Cotta & Fernandez (2009), recently improved the results obtained by
the NN-SA and CLS algorithms. They considered the use of two local search
techniques (hill climbing, tabu search), as well as a technique based on genetic
algorithms. To do this, two forms of vicinity were used, the change of ones for
zeros (bit-flip) and the exchange of pairs (0,1) or (1,0) (position-swapping); results
reveal the superiority of the local search technique: the Tabu Search with swap
vicinity. The same authors presented an approach based on the application of a
hybrid nature memetic algorithm (Rodriguez, Cotta & Leiva 2011), in which was
extended the number of evaluations of the target function to 2 × 107 and a new
crossing operator was incorporated named Greedy. A total of 63 of 86 instances
was solved with this approach. Finally, Daisuke Yokoya (2009), propose a mathe-
matical model based on the restrictions that a BIBD must meet, the local search
technique Tabu Search, and the resolver of linear models CPLEX, in order to pro-
vide a solution to the well-known designing balanced incomplete blocks problem.
This proposal shows the best results obtained to date; a total of 78 of the 86
instances studied in the proposal were solved.

2. Methods
    Using the notation hv, b, r, k, λi, a hv, b, r, k, λi-BIBD problem consists of the
grouping of a series of v objects in b groups of k < v objects each in such a way
that a specific object in v belongs to r different groups, and any pair of objects
in v will be present in exactly λ < b groups. A standard form of representation
for a solution to the problem could be expressed in terms of the incidence matrix,
M ≡ {mij }v×b , as is presented in Hall (1998). This is subject to the following:
                    (
                     1 1 if treatment i appears in block j
              mij =
                     0 1 if treatment j does not appears in block j.

                                      P                 b
                                                        P
      Furthermore,         mij = r,         mij = k,          mij mi0 j = λ; i = 1, 2, · · · , v; j =
                     j=1              i=1               j=1
1, 2, . . . , b; with i 6= i0 ;i, i0 = 1, 2, . . . , v. An example of this representation can be
observed in Figure 1, which shows the incidence matrix M for a possible solution
to the instance h8, 14, 7, 4, 3i-BIBD.

   The relation between the parameters hv, b, r, k, λi must satisfy vr = kb; r(k −
1) = λ(v − 1); λ = r(k−1)
                    (v−1) and b > v (Fisher’s (1940) inequality). Also, if v = b
and r = k, we have a symmetric design.


2.1. Vectorial Approach for hv, b, r, k, λi-BIBD
    If we analyze the incidence matrix, we can see that the representation of each
one of the rows of the matrix is given by a binary components vector in the space
Rn . The totality of the vector space represents the possible v treatments of the
design to be built. Evidently not all the vectors correspond to feasible treatments
because some of them will not meet the necessary Pb conditions that a valid BIBD
must have. On the other hand, the condition j=1 mij mi0 j = λ allows a direct
relationship to be established between the value of λ and the α angle between
two specific vectors of the vector space. According to vector algebra we have that
u, ν ∈ Rb , with binary components, and with the operations of the scalar product

                                            Revista Colombiana de Estadística 39 (2016) 267–280

of vectors, vector module, inequality of Cauchy-Schwarz, and the angle between
two vectors, allows us to establish that, for any pair of vectors m1j y m2j , with
j = 1, 2, . . . , b, the following must be met:

                                             m1j m2j = λ                                             (1)


      This represents a necessary and sufficient condition for a specific vector from
the vector space to be part of a feasible treatment that will allow theP construction
                                                                          b
of a valid BIBD. Therefore, we deduce that u.v = λ. In addition, j=1 u2j = r,
                                                            √
considering that uj ∈ {0, 1}. Because of this, |u| = |ν| = r, from which it results
that the α angle formed     by two vectors that represent a feasible treatment, is
given by α = arccos λr . Additionally to this condition, the parameter k should
be considered to determine the number of objects in each group b. This will allow
the establishment of another condition that a specific vector present in the vector
space should meet in order to be considered a feasible treatment and to establish
a valid   BIBD. Thus, theP  total number of elements in the vector space is given by
 b
                             v
 r   , and if the condition   i=1 mij = k is introduced, only a subspace of the vector
space is used.



2.2. Local Search Technique for hv, b, r, k, λi-BIBD

    This section describes the proposal for the utilization of the metaheuristic tech-
niques Hill Climbing and Tabu Search. It taken into consideration the considered
vicinity, the multi-agent proposal, as well as the objective function and the ele-
ments of the local search.


2.2.1. Neighborhood

    When processing a feasible treatment, for example, considering vector u as
a starting point for the construction of a BIBD, whether v is a valid candidate
treatment should be verified. For the instance: h14, 26, 13, 7, 6i, with

            u = h0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1i,

and considering that ν = h0, 1, 1,6 1,                                            0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1i,
                                        0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, √
then α = arccos λr = arccos 13           = 1.0911, with u.ν = 6, |u| = 13 and |u||ν| =
13. As such, vector v is a valid candidate treatment. With another vector, for
example ν 0 = h1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0i, you can
verify that the angle between hu, ν 0 i or hν, ν 0 i is different because 1.0911 6= 1.0697,
which indicates that ν 0 does not belong to the considered vicinity. Another im-
portant aspect has to do with the reductionPv          of the vicinity as well as guiding the
search; this relates to the condition i=1 mij = k. Continuing with the previous
example, after several iterations, you obtain a candidate BIBD,BI7 equal to:

      According to the condition, to following is obtained:

                            32334354532245444453323335

If the k parameter is considered, the number of some of the missing in each column
would be:
                           45443423245532333324454442

    Through this condition we can see, that it is possible to try to guide the process
primarily considering search those vectors that meet this restriction. The proposal
has considered prioritizing the evaluation of those vectors of the vector space with
components of the incidence matrix, with values taken from the first λ-columns
where there is a higher deficit of ones, besides the angle between the vectors that
already conforms the candidate BIBD. As such, a new candidate could be

                                                           Pb
    After evaluating the angle conditions and the condition j=1 mij mi0 j = λ, the
new condition will be considered part of the solution and, because of this, it will
be incorporated into the BI candidate.

    However, if the priority be vectors to considered are not feasible treatments,
you proceed to take the components according to the lowest number of violations
of the restrictions.
    There is a marked difference between our approach and the are presented by
Rodriguez et al. (2011). The first one uses a vectorial scheme that allows major
levels of exploration (i.e diversification) due to the fact that the measure of distance
used here to separate the neighbors is different from that used in Rodríguez. This
allow zones of search space that are more distant to be explored.

to construct the desired BIBD is available. As long as j=1 mij = r, it should
be applied each time there is a feasible treatment to incorporate. If a BIBD
candidate contains v treatments, the global optimum will be reached if there is a
configuration M ∗ so that f hv,b,r,k,λi (M ∗ ) = 0.

2.2.3. Local Search Techniques

   In this proposal, the metaheuristic techniques of Hill Climbing (Hc ) and Tabu
Search (Ts ) have been used in the search for a valid BIBD. Basically, the process
consists of taking a candidate treatment νi from the vector space ϕ ∈ Rb , so that:
                                         
                                         b
                         {νi ∈ ϕ | νi ∈     i = 1, 2, . . . , v}
                                         r

where hv, b, ri represents parameters in the design that is being locked for. If νi
                                          Pb
satisfies the angular conditions and the j=1 mij mi0 j = λ, it should be included as
a BIBD candidate BIi . And, if any of the restrictions are not satisfied, the vector is
discarded and a new vector is taken from ϕ. It is clear that the number of neighbors
available to be evaluated is a considerable size, mainly for instances with a greater
number of blocks. This makes it difficult to evaluate the totality of the vector space.
Because of this, for example, for an instance like h14, 26, 13, 7, 6i, there is a total
of 6.476475253248 × 1016 neighbors to process. For the case of the Hc technique,
after the evaluation of b2 vectors from the vector space without being able to
add a new treatment, the search is restarted from another starting point (new
vector generated randomly from Rb that will meet the restriction in the incidence
matrix where the value of the parameter r will indicate the amount of components
with value “one” and the remainders with value “zero”). Clearly BI will contain,
once again, only one vector i = 1 (BI1 ). Additionally, the tabu search algorithm
has been considered and is, also defined on the basis of the vector space for its
vicinities, with an exploration equal to Hc . Other parameters important to the
Tabu algorithm are: a) a vector νi ∈ ϕ previously evaluated is considered “tabu”,
b) the tabu persistence is chosen based on the parameter v from the instance that
will be processed, c) the desired criteria consists in finding a new feasible vector
that will be a valid treatment, d) after the exploration of b2 vectors from the vector

space, the search is intensified or diversified. The intensification is undertaken by
going back over the best solution that can be found by substituting one of the
vectors from the BIBD under construction (BIi−1 ). This vector will be selected
randomly from the previously placed i vectors. Diversification is undertaken
                                                                          Pb       by
restarting from a new vector of the vector space ϕ, as long as it meets j=1 mij =
r, with a probability of 1/16.
   Besides the techniques described in Section 2.2.3, we have also introduced two
Multi-Agent models based on: (a) the studied metaheuristics (b) our approach and
the approach presented by Daisuke Yokoya (2009). Both cases uses a centralized
outline with an independent search has been used.

2.2.4. Multi-Agent Proposal: Hc and T s Agents

    This approach only includes the metaheuristics presented at the beginning
of this section and a group of 30 individuals initial solutions are applied, which
will later be delivered to the cooperating algorithms. The group of algorithms
employed corresponds to the two proposals presented in this article Hc and Ts .
Other relevant parameters used can consider one of the proposals for each of the
two versions: a version that randomly takes a vector from the vector space as
an initial candidate a version that takes a possible design as an initial candidate
(surely with various vectors from the space that have been proven as valid treat-
ments) from the group of feasible candidates. Additionally, the group of candidate
solutions will begin with the application of the algorithm Ts . It will have a random
start for approximately 1 second of CPU time, and a total of 30 runs. At one mo-
ment of time there will only be two algorithms running simultaneously. After two
consecutive runs of a specific algorithm without contribution, it will be replaced
by another algorithm from the group. It is said that there is no contribution if the
solution obtained by the algorithm is worse than the existing ones, or if the ob-
tained individual is the same as one of the existing ones. The method of assigning
an initial solution can be done in several ways: a) take a solution randomly from
the group as long as it is not tabu, b) assign according to a quality percentage
of the individuals, without considering the tabu condition, and c) assign the best
individual of the group without considering the tabu condition. The quality per-
centage applied has been 25%. A higher percentage was tried but it did not show
improvement. The tabu persistence used was based on the value of the parameter
v for each instance. The cooperation was executed until a solution was obtained
or a maximum of 30 runs was reached. Finally, each run was performed for a
maximum of approximately 500 seconds of the CPU.

2.2.5. The T ABU (20), Hc and T s Agents

   In this scenario, besides the algorithms Hc and T s a proposal named T ABU (20)
presented by Daisuke and Takeo has been included. The mechanism employed is
similar to the one presented in section 2.2.4, with slight differences, such as: a)
the group of algorithms is composed by three algorithms that correspond to Hc ,
Ts and T ABU (20) in their cooperating version. The non-cooperating version of

Ts has been used to initiate the group of initial candidates, b) a group of 100
initial solutions has been employed, c) for the initiation of the group algorithm,
Ts has been used, d) cooperation was executed until a solution was obtained or a
maximum of 25 runs was reached, and e) each run was performed for a maximum
of approximately 100 seconds of the CPU.


3. Results
    The tests were performed on 86 instances taken from Prestwich (2003a), Ro-
driguez et al. (2009), Bofill et al. (2003) with vb ≤ 1000 and k 6= 3, see table 1.
These correspond to the cases that have a higher degree of complexity to find the
solution reported in these works. It was taken into account that for those instances
where k = 3 it is considerably less complicated to find a solution.

   The tests were executed on an Intel computer with a dual core processor at 2.5
GHZ. Three different scenarios have been presented for the tests. These correspond
with the local searches, the cooperation between the two proposed local searches,
and the cooperation between the local searches and the technique described by
Daisuke y Takeo. The maximum time used in each run for the local searches was

that only involves the local searches. In the second cooperation proposal, each run
was executed in a maximum of 100 seconds of the CPU. Results present the best
times obtained to be resolved each one of the indicated instances. Table 2 presents

local search methods Hill Climbing (Hc ) and Tabu Search (Ts ). We can observe
that algorithm Ts is able to resolve 72 of the 86 instances compared whit Hc ,
which resolves 70 of the 86. The response times in both proposals are relatively
similar. In column 4 we observe the results when applying a cooperation model
in which algorithms Hc and Ts are applied. In this case 74 of the 86 instances are
resolved. Finally column 5 summarizes the best times obtained by the cooperative
proposal, including the algorithms. There are presented here as will as in the

4. Conclusions
   We have presented an algorithm with a constructive approach which allows a
great number of instances to be resolved for the problem of the design of balanced
incomplete blocks using a technique of local search based on a multi-start. It can

                                                      Revista Colombiana de Estadística 39 (2016) 267–280

be confirmed that by using cooperative mechanisms and incorporating multiple
agents you can achieve a better performance from the techniques. However, there
are still instances for which it has not been possible to reach optimal solutions,
but it should be mentioned that the feasible solutions found are very close to the
optimal globals. However, an advantage of our approach lies in the major capacity
to explore of new zones (major diversification). This is unlike other approaches
that use major intensification, for example the vectorial approach. Normally one of
the disadvantages of the process of intensification is the wide possibility of finding
many local optima: something that can be solved by using the diversification
method.
    In practical situations, adoption of a complete block design is not appropriate
and in several cases, not at all feasible. This fact prompted the development of
various kinds of incomplete block designs, which, in turn, have been used exten-
sively for experiments in differents areas. Moreover, these designs opened up many
challenging problems in combinatorial optimization. In addition to the classical
IBD (incomplete block designs), the BIB (balanced incomplete block) and PBIB
(partially balanced incomplete block) designs are still found tu be useful in several
applications.
    We believe that the benefits of this proposal seem to be very promising. For
this reason we have presented the work hypothesis that an adequate specialization
of the search algorithms could open the door to resolve of many of these instances.
Therefore, in terms of future work, we consider hybridizing the presented pro-
posals, employing genetic algorithms and methods of local search. From another
perspective, we can attempt to employ a different model the presentation the can-
didate solutions, as well as, study other local search techniques: Iterated Local
Search (ILS), Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS).
