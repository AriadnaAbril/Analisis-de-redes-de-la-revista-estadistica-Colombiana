Synthesizing the Ability in Multidimensional Item Response Theory 
Universidad Nacional de Colombia
Abstract
A central problem associated with Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) Models is the impossibility of ordering the examinees. In this paper, we obtain two unidimensional synthetic indices that are optimal linear combinations of the ability vector. These synthetic indices are similar to the reference composite commonly used in MIRT models, but they are easier to calculate and interpret. The synthetic indices are compared with the unidimensional ability obtained when a multidimensional data is fitted with an unidimensional IRT (UIRT) model.
Key words: Binary response, Item response theory, Index, Multidimensional data, Synthetic estimator, Latent trait.

2    Introduction
This research originated in recent results obtained by Levine (2003) and Carroll
& Levine (2007) in the context of Multidimensional Item Response Theory.
They proved that any multidimensional model has unidimensional submodels
that are equivalent to the original model.
    The unidimensional item response theory models (UIRT) consist of models
according to which the interactions of persons with items can be adequately
represented by a unique parameter describing the characteristics of the person
(Reckase 2009).
    The multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models are based on
the assumption that people require more than one basic ability to response
correctly to an item in a test. There are two major types of MIRT models-the
compensatory models Reckase (1985, 1997, 2007) and the non-compensatory or
partial compensatory models (Sympson 1978). In this research, we only refer to
the compensatory MIRT models, that we will call them simply MIRT models.
    Stout (1990) introduced the concept of essential unidimensionality. The
central idea of Stout is that even though the ability space is multidimensional,
the set of items used in a test may be sensitive, mainly to differences along one
of the dimensions. The statistical tests to assess unidimensionalidad can reject
the unidimensional assumption. Stout et al. (1999) developed DIMTEST, a
procedure to test the assumption of essential unidimensionality of the person’s
ability.
    Several authors tried to determine the relationship between the ability vec-
tor θ and the unidimensional ability denoted θ, obtained by fitting a unidimen-
sional model to data that were generated from multidimensional models. Ansley
& Forsyth (1985) examined the unidimensional estimates for two dimensional
data using a noncompensatory model. They studied situations in which the θ
’s were correlated with correlations values of 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 0.95 . Way
et al. (1988) also compared the effects of using a UIRT model to estimate two
dimensional data for both the noncompensatory and the compensatory MIRT
model. Reckase (1990, 1986) reported that, in some situations, where a multi-
dimensional data matrix was fitted with a UIRT model, the dimensionality and
the difficulty were confused.
    Ackerman (1989) reported that, in his simulations, the unidimensional es-
timate of θ was highly correlated with (θ1 + θ2 ) /2; this correlation was better
when the correlation of the abilities was increased. Reckase & Ackerman (1988)
suggested to build unidimensional tests from multidimensional items by group-
ing the items that measure more similar the linear combinations of abilities.
    Folk & Green (1989) stated that θb is strongly related to some optimal com-
bination of θ1 and θ2 , even for simulate samples with low correlations. Doody
(1985) reported studies about the robustness of unidimensional fitting applied to
two dimensional data. Zhao et al. (2002), in a simulated study of computerized
adaptive tests, founded similar results. As Ackerman, they compared the ability
θb with (θ1 + θ2 ) /2. Walker & Beretvas (2003) compared multidimensional and
uni- dimensional proficiency using real data from a large-scale mathematics test


                                       2

and obtained similar results.
    Recently, Sheng (2007) showed that when each one of the items measures
essentially only one ability, a multi-unidimensional model fits better the data.
    In this paper, we review the previous works about the important issue of syn-
thesizing the latent ability vector in MIRT models. We derive two optimal linear
combinations of the components of the ability vector, which are synthetic indices
of the abilities. Through a simulation study, we compared the proposed indices
with the others proposed previously, and we infer that all the synthetic indices
are similar. Our indices are easier to compute and interpret by the experts.
The synthetic indices obtained are also estimations of the linear combination
of the latent ability vector that is best measured by a test. We state how the
covariance of the latent ability vector affects the synthetic index. Finally, we
infer through a second simulation study that when the multidimensional data is
fitted with a unidimensional model, the unidimensional latent ability is precisely
the synthetic index of the ability vector. In the paper, the terms latent ability
and latent trait are used as synonyms.


3    The geometrical facts
When a UIRT model is used to fit data set, it is usual to assume a normal
standard distribution for the abilities of the individuals. Clearly, if the data
is multidimensional, the correlation matrix of the ability vector is the identity
matrix. But, if really the correlation matrix is not the identity, the obvious
question is what happens with the item and the ability parameters when this
information about the correlation matrix of the abilities is omitted?
     The works reviewed in Section 1 1suggested us that when a data set is
generated from a MIRT model and the correlation matrix of the ability vector
is not the identity, a unidimensional model can fit well the data. This lead us
to conjecture that if the unidimensional model is used with the assumption that
the abilities have a normal standard distribution, the correlation matrix of the
abilities transforms the direction of the items in such a way that in the extreme
case all of them must be aligned. The direction of an item is discussed in Section
3 Also, the results reported in Section 1 seems to suggest that in the extreme
case the unique direction of the items is just √1d 1d , where d is the dimension of
the ability space. This conjecture lead us to propose and prove the results of
this Section. The required facts from d-dimensional geometry can be consulted
in the Appendix.
     Theorem 1. Let Σ be a d×d symmetric and positive definite matrix, such that
all its diagonal elements are 1 and the off-diagonal elements are nonnegative. Let
β 1 and β 2 be unitary vectors of Rd , such that all their elements are nonnegative.
Let |Σ| be the determinant of Σ, then

    Proof. Let Σ1/2 be the squared root of Σ. Let γi = Σ1/2 βi / βit Σβi , i =
1, 2. Then, the vectors γ1 and γ2 are unitary. Let vol (γ1 , γ2 ) be the volume of
the parallelotope determined by the vectors γ1 and γ2 . From equations (34),
(36) and (37) in the Appendix, it follows that
                                                                    2

   and

                                            |Σ|vol2 (β 1 , β 2 )

   The properties of matrix Σ permit us to conclude that βit Σβi ≥ 1, i = 1, 2.
The result follows from this fact and also from the previous two equations and
Lemma 3 in the Appendix.
   Corollary 1. Under the conditions of Theorem 1 we have that

                           β 1 Σβ 1 β 2 Σβ 2
   Proof. The result follows from the fact that |Σ| ≤ 1.
   In the next result, we assume that Σ1/2 m is the squared root of Σm .
   Theorem 2. Let Σm be a sequence of d × d matrices that have the same
properties than Σ in Theorem 1, and such that their determinants are decreasing
and that |Σm | → 0 as m → ∞. Let β m = Σ1/2β      m   , where β is any not-zero
vector, where all of its components are nonnegative. Thus, β m / ∥β m ∥ → √1d 1d ,
where 1d is the vector with 1’s at all its components.
   Proof. It is easy to see that |Σ| = 0, if and only if Σ = Jd , where Jd is the
matrix with 1’s in all of its components. Thus, Σ1/2
                                                   m →
                                                          √1 Jd .
                                                            d
   Suppose that Σ is a correlation matrix. It can be shown that if the off-
diagonal elements of the matrix Σ become large, then the determinant of the
matrix Σ decreases due to the relationship
                        2                    2                        2

             |Σ| = 1 − Rp.1···p−1       1 − Rp−1.1···p−2   · · · 1 − R2.1
            2
    where Rk...,d is the squared multiple correlation coefficient between the vari-
able k and the following variables. See, for example (Peña 2002), (Peña &
Rodríguez 2003).
    From theorems 1 and 2 we conclude that, if the off-diagonal elements of
the matrix Σ are increased, all the transformed vectors Σ1/2β  m    have a smaller
angle between them than the original vectors, and the respective transformed
normalized vectors have a greater orthogonal projection between them. Also,
all the transformed vectors are conducted toward the unitary vector √1d 1d . In
the limit case, all the transform vectors align with that unitary vector.

4       The nature of the items in the MIRT model
In this Section, we show that any item in a compensatory MIRT model is essen-
tially unidimensional and prove that the item response hypersurface of an item
in a MIRT model is monotonic along any direction. This property allows ex-
changing the item response function (IRF) and the item response hypersurface
(IRHS) as in the unidimensional case, but also permits us to determine what
an item really measures in a MIRT model.
    In the logistic two parameter model (Baker & Seok-Ho 2004), (Bock 1972),
(Bock & Jones 1968), (Hambleton et al. 1991), the probability of a correct
response for the unidimensional case is given by
                                                                      1
                  pj (θi ) = P (Xij = 1 | θi , aj , bj ) =
                                                             1 + e−aj (θi −bj )
    where Xij is the response of person i to item j; Xij = 1 if the examinee i
responses correctly to item j, and Xij = 0 otherwise; θi is the unidimensional
ability parameter for person i. The scale parameter aj is called the discrimina-
tion parameter of item j, and bj is the difficulty or position parameter of item
j.
    The function fj (θ) = pj (θ) is called the item response function (IRF) and
its graph is the item response curve (IRC). Note that
                                                     1
                                        fj (bj ) =
                                                     2
       and,
                                              1
                                       f ′ (bj ) =
                                                aj
                                              4
       so, except by the term 1/4, aj represents the slope of the IRC at the point
bj .
    In the classical compensatory MIRT model, there is more that one ability
measured by a test. Let θ i be a vector of Rd that represents the ability vector
of the examinee i. The parameters of item j in this case are: aj , a vector of
Rd related with the discrimination of the item and γj , a scalar related with the
difficulty of the item. The probability that an examinee with ability vector θ i
responses correctly to item j is given by
                                                                1
                      P (Xij = 1 | θ i , aj , γj ) =
                                                             −(atj θ i +γj )
                                              1+e
   The component θik of θ i represents the ability of the person i in the k-th
dimension. The interpretations of aj ’s and γj ’s parameters are a little different
from those in the unidimensional case. Reckase (1985, 1997, 2007) states that the
MIRT model does not provide a direct interpretation about the parameters aj
and γj . In this case, the item response function fj (θ) = pj (θ) is a multivariate
function and its graph is a hypersurface. Let αj be the norm of the vector aj ,
that is,


                                              5

   where the ajk ’s are the components of vector aj . Then, the vector aj can
be rewritten as

                                          aj = αj β j
                                      t
    where β j = (βj1 , βj2 , . . . , βjd ) , βjk = ajk /αj . Clearly, β j is a unitary vector
of Rd . Thus, the model given by Equation (8) can be rewritten as
                                                                  1

                                                        1+e
    where bj = −γj /αj . Reckase (1985) defined the value αj as the multidi-
mensional discrimination (MDISC) parameter and the value bj as the multidi-
mensional difficulty (MDIFF) parameter. He showed that αj is the slope at the
point of the steepest slope in the direction specified by the vector β j , called the
direction of item j.
    Additionally, he proved that bj is the distance from the origin to the point
of the steepest slope. We will show in this Section why the MDISC and MDIFF
names are justified.
    At this point, we introduce the concept of item response hypersurface. In the
UIRT models, one may use the item response function (IRF) and its geometrical
representation-the item response curve (IRC)-almost interchangeable. In the
multidimensional case, however, the matter is not so straightforward.

    Definition 1. A dichotomous item response hypersurface is a d-dimensional
smooth submanifold M of Rd × [0, 1], so that for any two vectors v, w ∈ Rd the

fv,w : w + R · v → [0, 1].

                                     1+e
    is a dichotomous item response hypersurface.
    Proof. Let v, w be two arbitrary vectors of Rd and consider the line given by
η(t) = w + tv, t ∈ R. Clearly, β tj η(t) = β tj w + β tj v t is a monotonic function
of t and then f (η(t)) is a monotonic function along the direction v through w.


                                              6

     As a consequence of Lemma 1 the item response function (11) defines a
dichotomous item response hypersurface and the MIRT model is completely
determined by these hypersurfaces.
     Lemma 2. The item response function fj (θ) of a MIRT model is constant
in the orthogonal complement of vector β j .
     Proof. For any vector η in the orthogonal subspace of β j , β tj η = 0, so,
fj (η) = 1/ (1 + e−αj γj ).
     The next Corollary can be directly proven.
     Corollary 2. Given w ∈ Rd , the item response function fj (θ) is constant in
the hyperplane parallel to the orthogonal complement of vector β j that contains
w.
     This Corollary is well-known. It states that the contours of equiprobability
are hyperplanes, and that all of them are parallel. However, the important fact
is that they are orthogonal to the vector β j . Theorem 3 is the main result of this
Section. It establishes that the item response function fj (θ) is a trivial extension
of a unidimensional item response function (UIRF). According to Equation (9)
we will use the expression aj = αj β j in the Proof. It is not necessary, but is
useful to understand the result.
     Theorem 3. The multidimensional IRF fj (θ) of a MIRT model is a trivial
extension of a classical UIRF.                 
     Proof. Let θ be a vector in Rd , and let β j , v 1 , . . . , v d−1 be a normed or-
thogonal basis of Rd that contains the vector β j . Then, there exist real numbers
t, t1 , . . . , td−1 such that

                              θ = tβ j + t1 v 1 + · · · + td−1 v d−1
   then,

                                        β tj θ = β tj β j t = t
                                                         

   Hence,

                          1                       1                1
       fj (θ) =         −αj β tj θ−γj
                                         =                 =                  = pβj (t)

    The notation pβj is used to emphasize the direction β j , and that fj (θ)
is an extension of a UIRF. Theorem 3 shows an explicit way to construct the
hypersurface defined by fj (θ) from a unidimensional IRC. Let pj (t) be the UIRF
defined by
                                                       1
                                   pj (t) =
                                                1 + e−αj (t−bj )
    The function pj (t) can be trivially extended to a multivariate function by
pj (t1 , . . . , td ) = pj (t1 ). The original hypersurface is obtained by a rigid rotation
of the hypersurface defined by pj (t1 , t2 , . . . , td ) on the hyperplane defined by the
canonical vectors e1 , e2 , . . . , ed , which aligns vector e1 with vector β j . This is


                                                  7

a general result, since any rotation in Rd can be done in this way. The theory of
rigid rotations in d-dimensional spaces can be found in Aguilera & Pérez-Aguila
(2004) and Mortari (2001). A direct and important consequence of Theorem 3
is stated in the next Corollary.
    Corollary 3. Let’s suppose that the directions of all items in a MIRT model
coincide, that is, β i = β, for all i. Then, the model is essentially unidimensional.
In other words, the MIRT model is a trivial extension of a UIRT model.
    The result of Corollary 3 was first proven by Stout and Reckase in a paper
presented at a meeting of the Psychometric Society (Reckase & Stout 1995).
Reckase (2009) reproduced the result (Theorem 1, page 197).
    Other useful properties of the MIRT model follow. On the hyperplane β tj θ−
bj = 0 we have that

                                           fj (θ) = 1/2
    It is straightforward to verify that for all θ in that hyperplane
                                 ∂fj       1
                                     (θ) = αj β j
                                 ∂θ        4
    So, as in Equation (7), the parameter αj , except by the constant 1/4, is
the slope of the IRHS for all θ in the hyperplane β tj θ − bj = 0. The slope in
the direction β j is maximum when the IRHS crosses the hyperplane (Reckase
1985).
    From equations (10), (15) and (16), we can conclude that IRHS of item j in
the MIRT model is a trivial extension of a unidimensional IRC whose parameters
of discrimination and difficulty are respectively αj and bj = −γj /αj . Also, it is
clear that item j measures the linear combination of the abilities given by β tj θ.


5     Synthesizing the latent ability
A unidimensional synthetic index of the latent trait vector in a MIRT model is
usually called a composite. The formal concept is given in Definition 2
    Definition 2. A composite Θβ of the complete latent trait vector Θ is a linear
                                           Pd                                        t
combination of Θ, that is Θβ = β t Θ = k=1 βk Θk , where β = (β1 , β2 , . . . , βd )
is a constant vector called the direction of the composite Θβ . If Var (Θβ ) = 1, Θβ
will be called a normalized composite. Some authors have done theoretically
developments to construct a unidimensional synthetic index of the latent trait
vector. Yen (1985) considered an approximation of a MIRT model by a UIRT,
using a least squares (LS) approach. She used the objective function
                                  XXh                                      i2

                                 t
         a = (ab1 , . . . , abp ) , bb = bb1 , . . . , bbp , θb = θb1 , . . . , θc
   where b                                                                       N    are the corre-
sponding parameters in an approximate UIRT model, and p is the number of


                                                 8

items. The respective LS equations do not have a closed solution. Then, she
assumed the particular case where β i = β, i = 1, . . . , p, to obtain the solution

                                         βt θi
                                  θbi = p t
                                         β Σβ
    where Σ is the covariance matrix of the latent trait θ. This result can be
obtained as a direct consequence of Theorem 3 since in this particular case all
directions of the items coincide, and then we have essentially a UIRT along the
direction β.                                          Pm
    Let {X1 , . . . , Xm } be a subtest, and let Y = j=1 Xj be the subtest number
                              Pm
correct score, let ξ(θ) = j=1 pj (θ) be the true subtest score. Zhang & Stout
(1999) defined the direction of score Y as the vector ξ that maximizes the
expected multidimensional critical ratio (EMCR) defined as
                                                                
                                                     ∇ξ ξ(θ)
                          EMCR(ξ, θ; Y ) = E                   1
                                                  [Var(Y | θ)] 2
    where ∇ξ ξ(θ) is the directional derivative of the true score ξ(θ) in the di-
rection ξ. The EMCR function gives the average discrimination power of the
observed score Y in the direction ξ. They showed that vector ξ is given by
                                       m
                                       X
                                  ξ=         ωi β j
                                       j=1
                      h                              i
    where ωi = cE Hi′ αj β tj θ + γj / Var(Y | θ) .Hi (·) represents the item
                                       p

response function. Clearly, the direction ξ in Equation (201) depends on the
response function, and it is an average on the latent trait population. In this
case, ξ t θ is the composite that is best measured by the subtest. The reference
direction ξ was called the direction of the subtest.
    Wang (1985, 1986) constructed a unidimensional approximation to a multi-
dimensional data matrix that he called the reference composite trait. He used
the transformation y = ln[p/(1 − p)], the item logistic score, and rewrote the
logistic MIRT model as

                                Y = θAt + 1K γ t
    where θ is the matrix of the latent traits, A is the K × d matrix of the
discrimination parameters in the MIRT model, K is the number of items, 1K
is the K-vector of ones and γ is the vector associated with the difficulty. The
objective function in this case is the trace of (Y − Yb )t (Y − Yb ), where Yb =
GH t + 1K γ t . Here G is the unidimensional latent trait in the approximate
model and H is the vector of discrimination item parameters in that model.
Observe that it is assumed that the difficult parameters do not change. Wang
showed that in this case

                                     G = θω


                                        9

    where ω is the (unit-length) eigenvector associated with the largest eigen-
value of the matrix At A.
    Theorem 3 states that all items in a compensatory MIRT model are essen-
tially unidimensional. Then, the multidimensional nature of a MIRT model can
only be attributed to the item directions β j . Corollary [3] states that when
the directions of all items coincide, the model is a trivial extension of a UIRT
model. These results encouraged us to derive a unidimensional synthetic ability
in a different way than Yen, Wang, and Zhang and Stout.
    We observed that if all β j ’s are the same, and β j = β, j = 1, . . . , K, where
K is the number of items in the test, then Equation (10) reduces to
                                                      1
                  P (Xij = 1 | θ i , αj , β, bj ) =       t
                                               1 + e−αj (β θi −bj )
    that is a trivial extension of an UIRT model, where each one of the items
measures the same composite of the abilities given by β t θ i . This observation
suggests looking for a vector β that summarizes the β j ’s. Since these vectors
are all unitary, they are in the unitary hypersphere of Rd . Also, we can assume
that the components of the vectors β j are all non-negative, then all the vectors
are in the same hyper-quadrant. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the
vector that summarizes all the β j ’s is the same hyper-quadrant of the unitary
hypersphere. This leads us to search the vector β by optimizing the objective
function given by
                                                   K

   We will denote the solution vector in this case as β h .

   The solution vector in this case will be denoted as β g .
   We finish this Section with an approach about the role of the latent trait
correlation matrix. It is usual to assume that the abilities of the examinees


                                                 10

in a test constitute a sample drawn from a normal d-dimensional distribution
N (0, Σ). The marginal EM estimation is based on this assumption (Bock &
Aitkin 1981).
    To obtain an identifiable model, most of the programs written to estimate
MIRT models assume that Σ = I d , where I d is the identity matrix. Examples
are TESTFACT (Wilson et al. 1987) and recently the Itm package (Rizopoulos
2006). Those are examples of programs that use this assumption. In general,
this is not a realistic situation. Software NOHARM (Fraser 1988) estimates the
item parameters and the correlation matrix, but it does not estimate the latent
abilities. Bégin & Glass (2001) and De la Torre & Patz (2005) proposed MCMC
algorithms that simultaneously estimate the item parameters, the latent abilities
and the matrix Σ. In this work, we assume only that the diagonal elements are
all 1 . This assumption defines a common scale along the canonical axis of the
ability space. Ackerman (1989) stated that, in the case where the matrix Σ is
not the identity, the difficulty and the dimensionality can be confused.
    The usual assumption that the correlation matrix is the identity probably
resulting the problem mentioned by Ackerman. Let’s assume that θ, the latent
ability of the examinees, is a sample from a normal distribution N (0, Σ). Then
Σ has the stochastic representation θ = Σ1/2 Υ, where Υ has a multivariate
normal standard distribution, and Σ1/2 is the squared root of Σ. Then, we
have that
                                            t
                               β t θ = Σ1/2 β Υ

   Hence, when in the estimation process it is assumed that the correlation
matrix is the identity matrix, the direction of each item is estimated in a trans-
formed space determined by Σ1/2 . Equation (28) shows a procedure to compute
the reference direction when the correlation matrix is available.
   It is clear that if θ has a multivariate normal distribution     N (0, Σ), any
composite β t θ has a different scale, since Var β t θ = β t Σβ. In this case,
                                                       

the reference direction must be computed from the transformed vectors Σ1/2 β,
and the synthetic ability must be computed using the transformed ability Υ =
Σ−1/2 θ.


6     Simulation study
Two simulations were developed to evaluate and compare the synthetic indices
β th θ and β tg θ. This indices are compared with the synthetic indices ξ t θ and
ω t θ, where ξ is the reference direction obtained by Zhang and Stout and ω is
the reference direction obtained by Wang.

6.1    Comparison of the reference directions
Conceptually, the construction of the reference direction of Wang and the ref-
erence directions proposed in this paper are very similar. The construction of


                                       11

the reference direction proposed by Zhang and Stout is different.
    The vector ξ is the direction in which the total score Y has maximum dis-
criminating power (Zhang & Stout 1999). The vector ω maximizes the projec-
tion of the direction of the items along of it. The vector β h essentially minimizes
the angle between this reference direction and the direction of the items. The
vector β g minimizes the distance between this reference direction and the di-
rection of the items as points of the latent space. However, all the directions
are very similar as we show in this Section.
    To review this fact, we generate a set of 60 vector directions in the 3 -
dimensional latent space. We generate 4 clusters, each one with fifteen direc-
tions. To do that, we fixed four directions: b1 = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)t , b2 = (1.0, 0.2, 0.1)t , b3 =
(0.3, 1.0, 0.1)t and b4 = (0.25, 0.25, 1.0)t . Then, we generate the vectors of each
cluster by adding random noise to each component of the vectors b. The noise
is smaller in cluster 1 and is augmented progressively until cluster 4 .
    In a second step, we compute the reference directions ω, β h and β g , from all
the item directions and from the item directions in each cluster. Additionally,
we simulate values of MDISC and MDIFF parameters to generate all the item
parameters for 60 items, and then we also computed the reference direction
ξ from all the items and from the items in each cluster. We used a logistic
response function, and Equation (20).
    We considered two different distributions for the latent ability. First, we
assumed a 3-variate normal standard distribution and then a 3-variate normal
distribution N (0, Σ), where
                                                     
                                       1.0 0.3 0.6
                              Σ =  0.3 1.0 0.4 
                                       0.6 0.4 1.0
    Tables 1 and 2 show the results. In Table 1 columns 3,4 and 5 correspond to
the components of the reference directions for the first distribution of the latent
abilities and columns 7,8 and 9 are the components of the reference directions
for the second distribution. Finally, we evaluate the synthetic indices comparing
them with the original composites. We computed the quantity
                                      Kv
                                 1 X  t

   where v is respective the cluster, and Kv the size of the cluster.

6.2       Comparison of the synthetic ability βht θ with the uni-
          dimensional ability of a UIRT model
To evaluate β th θ as a synthetic index of the latent trait vector, we used the
following strategy. It is reasonable to expect that the synthetic index of the
ability is a good unidimensional summary of the ability vector. Then, if a mul-
tidimensional data set is fitted with a unidimensional model, the unidimensional
estimative of the ability parameter must be also an estimative of the synthetic
index.
    In this Section, we evaluate the synthetic index β th θ in forty simulated ex-
amples. For clarity, the subscript h will be omitted. All examples are based on
2-dimensional models. One hundred item parameters were simulated as follows.
First, the MDISC (the αj ’s) parameters were generated from a uniform dis-
tribution in the range [.4, 2]. Second, the parameters bj were generated from a


                                            13

normal distribution N (0, 1). Third, the angles that determine the direction of
the vectors β j were generated from a uniform distribution in the range [5, 50].
The MDISC parameters were generated in the range [.4, 2] because, this is the
usual range of this parameter in real tests. Different prior distributions are as-
sumed for these parameters as a log-normal or a non-informative positive flat
distribution (Sheng 2008). We used the last option. The range of angles was
chosen to yield a more disperse set of angles as possible. In the simulation of
the previous Section, the simulated angles were less dispersed in each cluster.
    A sample of 4000 examinees was drawn from the normal bivariate distribu-
tion N (0, I d ). To examine the impact of the correlation between the θ ’s, we
respectively introduced correlations of 0, .3, .6 and .9 . In all cases, the diagonal
elements were 1 , thus Σ is always a correlation matrix. Also, in all cases a nor-
mal standard distribution is assumed for the ability vectors in the estimation
process.
    Finally, for each correlation matrix a set of binary responses were generated
as follows: for each ability vector and each parameter set, the probability of a
correct response was computed using Equation (8). Then, a random number u
was obtained, from the uniform distribution in the range [0, 1]. If the probability
of correct response was greater or equal than u the value 1 was assigned to the
response. Otherwise, the 0 value was assigned (Kromrey et al. 1999).
    We fitted 10 unidimensional models for each set of responses using the Itm
package (Rizopoulos 2006). First, we took the first 10 items; then, we took the
first 20 items and so until all items were taken. Table 3 shows the main results.
    A number of statistical indices were calculated at the simulate sample level
to evaluate the synthetic index β t θ. Let β k , k = 1, . . . , 40 be the vector β in
each one of the 40 simulations. Let θbi be the estimation of the ability parameter
obtained, when the multidimensional data was fitted with the unidimensional
model. The bias index can be expressed as
                                N
                             1 X t              
                  bias k =         β k θ i − θbi      (k = 1, . . . , 40)
                             N i=1
   The error index included is the mean absolute error (mae) defined as
                                N
                             1 X t
                   maek =         β θ i − θbi        (k = 1, . . . , 40)
                             N i=1 k
    To evaluate the precision of the mae index, we included the standard de-
viation sdk of values β tk θ i − θbi . A fidelity index was computed, the Pearson
productmoment rho correlation, denoted by ρ. Additionally, we computed the
least squares (LS) - fitting between the values β tk θ i and θbi . We took the syn-
thetic index as the explanatory variable. The c-values were the coefficients and
the R2 -values the corresponding R2 statistics of the fitting in each simulation.
    Also, we compared the estimations θbi with (θ1 + θ2 ) /2. The indices mae e1
and c1 were computed by replacing the values β tk θ i with the values (θ1 + θ2 ) /2
in the previous respective indices. TABLE 3: Statistical indices to evaluate the

synthetic index β t θ. The value p is the number of items, σ is the correlation
between the θ′ ’s, β1 and β2 are the components of vector β, γ1 and γ2 are the
minimum and maximum angles of the vectors β j with respect to the horizontal
in each simulation.

7    Discussion
Carroll & Levine (2007) and Levine (2003) proved that any MIRT model can be
approximated by unidimensional models. However, their approximate models
are non-parametric and the response functions are not necessarily monotone.
      In this paper, we reviewed the main aspects concerning to synthesize the
latent ability vector in compensatory MIRT models. We used composites, that
are linear combinations of the latent trait vector.
      Theorem 3 shows that each item j in a MIRT model is essentially unidimen-
sional along the direction given by the vector β j . Item j measures the composite
β j t θ i . Then, each item measures a different linear combination of the θ i , unless
all the vectors β j have the same direction.
      In realistic problems, where a test measures more than one latent trait,
the components of the latent trait vector are correlated. However, Equation
(28) shows that if the latent trait random vector θ has multivariate normal
distribution N (0, Σ), then any composite β t θ can be rewritten as Σ1/2 β t Υ,
where Υ has a normal standard distribution. This transformation has two
important consequences. First, according to Corollary 1 the transformation
induced by Σ1/2 shrinks the direction vectors β j . Second, if a vector β is
unitary, the composite β t Υ is normalized, and any normalized composite has a
normal standard distribution.
      In Section 3, we stated that each item is essentially unidimensional along the
direction of the item. In Corollary 3 we proved that if all the directions of the
items coincide, the test is essentially unidimensional along the unique direction
of the items.
      The important issue about how to obtain a unidimensional synthetic index
of the multidimensional latent trait was discussed in Section 4, Previous works
of Yen, Wang and Zhang and Stout was reviewed. Wang and Zhang and Stout
proposed two alternative synthetic indices, called    respectively reference compos-
ite (ω t θ) and the direction of the test ξ t θ . We proposed two new synthetic
                                                 

indices: β th θ and β tg θ. Computing these alternative indices can be easier that
Computing the previous indices, and they are more natural and easy to use by
the experts.
      Tables 1 and 2 of the first simulation study (Section 5.1) show that all the
reference directions are very similar. This is not surprising, because although
the constructions are different, the objective in all cases is the same: to obtain
a synthetic index of the multidimensional latent trait. However, if we joint
all the results, we can conclude additionally that each one of the reference


                                          17

composites is an approximation to the best composite that is measured by a
subtest. This fact, is illustrated in Section 4 where we compared the theoretical
synthetic index β th θ with the unidimensional latent trait index obtained by
fitting a multidimensional data set with a UIRT model.


11     Appendix
For the concepts of n-dimensional geometry, see for example (Kendall 1961). Let
v1 , . . . , vd be an ordered set of vectors in Rn , n ≥ d. The parallelotope 1 with
sides v1 , . . . , vd is the convex hull created by this vectors. This parallelotope
is denoted by P (v1 , . . . , vd ). It is well known that the volume or content of
P (v1 , . . . , vd ) is
                                                                1/2
                               vol (v1 , . . . , vd ) = V t V
   where V = (v1 , . . . , vd ), see for example (Mathai 1999). It is immediate that

                        vol (λv1 , . . . , vd ) = λ · vol (v1 , . . . , vd )
   Also, if S is region of Rn and Σ a n × n matrix, then

                                   vol(ΣS) = |Σ| vol(S)
   From Equation (35) it is straightforward that

                      vol (Σv1 , . . . , Σvd ) = |Σ| · vol (v1 , . . . , vd )
   Lemma 3. Let β 1 and β 2 be unitary vectors of Rn , then

                                vol2 (β 1 , β 2 ) = 1 − β t1 β 2
   Proof. It follows directly from Equation (33).

8    Conclusions and future work
From a geometrical point of view, we showed in this paper how in tests that
measure more than one latent trait the multidimensional latent trait vectors
can be synthesized to obtain unidimensional measures of the examinees. The
approach can be applied to subtests obtained from clusters of the items, or to
the full test.
    In the paper, nothing was stated about the item parameters that are esti-
mated when a unidimensional model is used to fit a multidimensional data set.
We showed that the correlation in the latent trait vector must be considered
when a synthetic latent trait must be computed. In this case, a right com-
putation implies to transform the direction of the items by a non orthogonal
projection. But, in this scenery, the open question is: how must be modified
the MDISC and MDIFF parameters to conserve approximately the same prob-
ability of response?. In other words, what is the relationship between the item
parameters of the MIRT model and the item parameters of the UIRT when a
unidimensional model is used to fit a multidimensional data set?.
