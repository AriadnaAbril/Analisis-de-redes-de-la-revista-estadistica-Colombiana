Nonparametric Time Series Analysis of the Conditional Mean and Volatility Functions for the COP/USD Exchange Rate Returns
Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad Nacional de Colombia
Abstract
The modeling and estimation of the conditional volatility associated with a stochastic process usually have been based on parametric ARCH type and stochastic volatility models. These time series models are very powerful in representing the dynamic stochastic properties of the data generating process only if the parametric functions are correctly specified. The nonparametric approach acquires importance as a complementary and flexible method to explore these properties without imposing particular functional forms on the conditional moments of process. This paper presents an application of nonparametric time series methods to estimate the conditional volatility function of the COP/USD exchange rate returns. Additionally, we estimate the conditional mean function under this approach.

2    Introduction
In numerous publications researchers have written about the important role that
associated volatility plays in a stochastic process, particularly in economics and
finance. For example, the estimation of a conditional volatility measure that
approximates its principal empirical features such as cluster volatility, asymme-
tries, leverage effects, and long memory, among others, is crucial for different
issues in finance, like financial risk management, asset pricing, and efficient
portfolio allocation. Subsequently, the development of models to adequately
approximate the volatility process has concentrated the attention of researchers
in the past two decades (Andersen, Bollerslev & Diebold 2009, Straumann 2005).
    In this way, most volatility models have concentrated the attention on the
parametric approach assuming an explicit functional form to the volatility pro-
cess. This being said since Engle’s (1982) Autoregressive Conditional Het-
eroscedasticity -ARCH- specification, where he explicitly expresses conditional
volatility as a linear function of past squared innovations of the process, there
has been an exponential growth of different parametric specifications. A short
list of these specifications: Bollerslev’s (1986) Generalized ARCH -GARCH-
model, Engle & Bollerslev’s (1986) Integrated GARCH -IGARCH- model, Nel-
son’s (1991) Exponential GARCH -EGARCH- model, Ding et al. (1993) Asym-
metric Power ARCH -APARCH- model, Baillie et al. (1996) Fractionally Inte-
grated GARCH -FIGARCH- model, and Davidson’s (2004) Hyperbolic GARCH
-HYGARCHmodel, among others. For a complete review of ARCH-type mod-
els, see Bollerslev et al. (1992), Bollerslev et al. (1994), and Andersen, Davis,
Kreiß & Mikosch (2009). The estimation of ARCH-type models is commonly
done by maximum likelihood under different distribution functions such as the
usual Gaussian distribution, the Student- t distribution, the Generalized Error
distribution (GED), and the skewed-Student distribution.


                                        2

    Jointly with ARCH-type models are also the Stochastic Volatility -SV- mod-
els. This class of parametric models presents, unlike ARCH models, an alterna-
tive approach to the specification of the volatility function where the standard
specification contains an unobserved variance component (latent state variable)
which is modeled directly as a linear stochastic process, such as an autore-
gression (Harvey et al. 1994). See Ghysels et al. (1996), Shephard (2005),
and Andersen, Davis, Kreiß & Mikosch (2009) for a complete overview about
SV models. The estimation of SV models covers a wide range of estimation
procedures, for instance quasi-maximum likelihood, applying the Kalman filter,
Bayesian estimation, generalized method of moments, and efficient method of
moments.
    However, as it is well-known, the parametric time series models are very pow-
erful in representing the stochastic dynamical properties of the data generating
process if the parametric functions are correctly specified (Hardle & Linton 1994,
Fan & Yao 2005), and searching for a parametric functional form is critical and
not always is a simple task, especially when the process has nonlinear character-
istics, as is the case of financial time series variables. Thus the nonparametric
approach gains importance as a way of searching more flexible models without
imposing particular functional forms of the conditional moments such as a mean,
variance, or density function of process. The nonparametric estimates may be
used as an end product or, perhaps more importantly, as a guide to identifying
a parametric model to be used in a subsequent stage or to validate an existing
one (Masry & Tjostheim 1995). Additionally, the estimation of nonparametric
regression functions is not always complicated; on the contrary, it usually takes
much less time estimation with respect to some more complicated parametric
models where convergence problems are commonly found in their estimation
algorithms.
    Although the use of nonparametric methods in time series analysis has a
long tradition, it has obtained popularity with modern nonparametric tech-
niques, particularly in the analysis of nonlinear time series, due to the existence
of large data sets and computational advances (Hardle et al. 1997). Some
references about the development of nonparametric time series theory and its
applications are: books by Hardle (1990), Fan & Gijbels (1996), and Fan & Yao
(2005), and the articles by Robinson (1983), Hardle et al. (1997), Tjostheim
(1999), and references therein. This approach is applied to a vast range of areas
in economics, and has come to obtain great popularity in financial economet-
rics, for example, in modeling the drift and diffusion process underlying asset
returns, among other issues in empirical finance. See, for example, Pagan &
Ullah (1988), Diabold & Nason (1990), Mizrach (1992), Bossaerts et al. (1995),
Bossaerts et al. (1996), AitSahalia (1996a), Ait-Sahalia (1996b), Ait-Sahalia
& Lo (1998), and Ait-Sahalia & Lo (2000). Particular studies using the non-
parametric approach to estimate the conditional volatility function are Engle
& Gonzalez-Rivera (1991), Bossaerts et al. (1995), Bossaerts et al. (1996),
Masry & Tjostheim (1995), Hardle & Tsybakov (1997), Fan & Yao (1998), and
Ziegelmann (2002).
    In this paper, we apply nonparametric time series methods to estimate


                                        3

the conditional mean and volatility functions for the Colombian Peso/US Dol-
lar COP/USD - exchange rate returns. The fundamental reason for studying
this variable is that the Colombian exchange rate has had significant variation
episodes generating great uncertainty, and with large and severe costs on various
economic sectors. Additionally, international asset pricing theories and inter-
national portfolio management depend on the expected foreign exchange rate
movements (Bollerslev et al. 1992); therefore this paper can be a contribution to
properly understand the foreign exchange rate dynamics using the advantages
of the nonparametric time series methods. The reason being that in Colom-
bia, almost all analyses about foreign exchange rate has been concentrated on
parametric models. The only nonparametric study for the COP/USD exchange
rate is by Julio et al. (2005). For international nonlinear analysis on exchange
rates using nonparametric procedures, see the studies by Meese & Rose (1990),
Diabold & Nason (1990), LeBaron (1990), Bossaerts et al. (1995), Bossaerts et
al. (1996), and Hardle & Tsybakov (1997).
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 makes a short description of the
nonparametric time series model and its different estimation methods. Section
3 applies the nonparametric model to estimate both the conditional mean and
volatility functions for the returns of the COP/USD exchange rate process.
Finally, Section 4 concludes.


3     The Nonparametric Time Series Model
The starting point of the data generating process of a strictly stationary discrete-
time stochastic process {Xt } defined on some probability space (Ω, F, P ) is the
general univariate nonlinear stochastic regression model given by


        Xt = m (Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) + σ (Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) εt ,   t = 1, . . . , T

    where m (xt−1 , . . . , xt−p ) = E (Xt | Xt−1 = x1 , . . . , Xt−p = xp ) is the nonlin-
ear autoregressive conditional mean (smooth) function, σ 2 (xt−1 , . . . , xt−p ) =
Var (Xt | Xt−1 = x1 , . . . , Xt−p = xp ) represents the nonlinear autoregressive
conditional variance (smooth) function, and {εt } is an independent and identi-
cally distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of random variables with E (εt | Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) =
0, Var (εt | Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) = 1, and independent of {Xt−1 , Xt−2 , . . .}.
    The model (11) is known as the Conditional Heteroscedastic Autoregressive
Nonlinear-CHARN- model; see Bossaerts et al. (1996), or the Nonparametric
Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic -NARCH- model; see Fan & Yao
(2005).
    This model is the most flexible nonparametric time series model because it
does not impose any (parametric) particular form on the conditional mean and
volatility functions. However, due to the well-known "curse of dimensionality"
problem, the estimation of equation (1) is complicated 11 As a consequence, it
is necessary to assume a certain level of structure on the conditional functions
m(·) and σ(·)2


                                              4

    The usual assumption is: suppose p = 1 such that the model (1) becomes

                               Xt = m (Xt−1 ) + σ (Xt−1 ) εt
    Following Hardle & Tsybakov (1997), and Fan & Yao (1998) if {Xt } is a
stationary process, the conditional variance function can be decomposed as
                                                                2
              σ 2 (x) = E Xt2 | Xt−1 = x − {E (Xt | Xt−1 = x)}
                                         

                         = g(x) − {m(x)}2
    such that the conditional variance estimate is based on the nonparametric
                                                                   2
estimation of g(x) and m(x) given by σbT2 (x) = gbT (x) − {m
                                                           b T (x)} .

3.1     Nonparametric Kernel Estimation
A way to obtain estimates of functions m(x) and g(x) is by applying the popular
Nadaraya-Watson estimator given by:
                                        PT
                                           t=2 K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT ) Xt
                      b T (Xt−1 ) =
                      m                   PT
                                             t=2 K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT )
                                        PT                          2
                                           t=2 K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT ) Xt
                       gbT (Xt−1 ) =      PT
                                              t=2 K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT )

    where K(·) : R → R is the (continuous, bordered, symmetric, and integrating
to one) Kernel function and hT > 0 is the bandwidth parameter (also smoothing
parameter), hT → 0 as T → ∞. The Nadaraya-Watson estimator is a special
case of the local polynomial estimation explained below. The Kernel functions
most commonly used are the Gaussian, Quartic, and Epanechnikov Kernels.
    These estimators are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal for α
mixing observations 33 see Robinson (1983), and Masry & Tjostheim (1995).
    with ai (·) and bi (·), i = 1, . . . , p one-dimensional unknown functions, and
Xt−d is the modeldependent variable. Another common model is the Additive
Autoregressive - AAR- model (Jones 1978) which assumes an additive structure
for conditional mean and variance,

                m (Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) = m1 (Xt−1 ) + · · · + mp (Xt−p )
                                                 2
                σ 2 (Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) = σ1 Xt−1                 2
                                                                        
                                                       + · · · + σp Xt−p
    1 Nonparametric regression estimators are very flexible, but their statistical accuracy

decreases greatly if there are several explicatory variables in the model (Hardle et al. 2004).
Additionally, their estimation is difficult unless the sample size is excessively large (Fan & Yao
2005), and (Fan & Gijbels 1996).
  2 A very popular nonparametric model is the Functional-Coefficient Autoregressive -

FARmodel (Chen & Tsay 1993), where the conditional mean and volatility functions are
specified as

                 m (Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) = a1 (Xt−d ) X1 + · · · + ap (Xt−d ) Xt−p
                                                                                  2
                σ 2 (Xt−1 , . . . , Xt−p ) = b1 (Xt−d ) X12 + · · · + bp (Xt−d ) Xt−p



                                                 5

    where mi (·) and σi (·), i = 1, . . . , p are univariate unknown functions. For
other nonparametric models such as Partially Linear models and Single-Index
Models, see Hardle & Tsybakov (1997), Hardle et al. (2004), Fan & Yao (2005),
and Gao (2007).

      A sequence is said to be α-mixing if α(n) → 0 when n → ∞, with α(n)
defined as

        α(n) =        sup         |P (A ∩ B) − P (A)P (B)|,             n = 1, 2, . . . ,
                    k

   where Fij is the σ-field generated by Xi , . . . , Xj . See Robinson (1983), and
Fan & Yao (2005).

3.2    Local Polynomial Regression
Another nonparametric technique used to estimate the functions m(x) and g(x)
is proposed by Hardle & Tsybakov (1997), who applied the local polynomial re-
gression method. The estimates for m(x) and g(x) functions are derived through
the solution of the following weighted least-squares problems:
                                 T
                                                        2
                                 X
             cT (x) = arg min          (Xt − c′ UtT ) K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT )
                        c∈Rl     t=1
                                 T
                                 X                      2
             c̄T (x) = arg min          Xt2 − c̄′ UtT        K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT )
                        c̄∈Rl    t=1

     where K(·) and hT > 0 are again the Kernel function and bandwidth pa-
                                                                                   ′
rameter, respectively, and UtT = F (utT ) with F (u) = 1, u, . . . , ul−1 /(l − 1)!
and utT = (Xt−1 − x) /hT (the symbol ’ denotes the transpose of a row vector).
Note that when l = 1, the local polynomial fit is reduce to the Nadaraya-Watson
estimator.
     The estimators of m(x) and g(x) are given by m    b T (x) = bcT (x)′ F (0) and
                ′
gbT (x) = cT (x) F (0), respectively; such that the estimator of the conditional
          b̄
variance functions is defined as
                                                                 2
                                                   cT (x)′ F (0)}
                      bT2 (x) = b̄cT (x)′ F (0) − {b
                      σ
    Hardle & Tsybakov (1997) establish the asymptotic normality of local poly-
nomial estimators for conditional mean and variance.
    In the application of the local polynomial nonparametric regression method
to estimate the volatility function to DM/USD and YEN/USD foreign exchange
rates Hardle & Tsybakov (1997) use a local linear approximation (l = 2), such
that




                                              6

                          T
                          X                                     2
      cT (x) = arg min          (Xt − c1 − c2 (Xt−1 − x)) K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT )
                 c∈R2     t=1
                          T
                          X                                     2
      c̄T (x) = arg min          Xt2 − c̄1 − c̄2 (Xt−1 − x)          K ((Xt−1 − x) /hT )
                 c̄∈R2    t=1

    Note that in the minimization problems in (5), employed to obtain local
approximation estimates of m(x) and g(x), the Kernel function and bandwidth
parameter are commons in both equations. This strategy is used by Hardle &
Tsybakov (1997) to avoid nonnegative estimators of σ 2 (x) and to reduce bias.
Therefore, Fan & Yao (1998) propose a residual-based estimator to conditional
variance based on local linear regression.
                                                      2
    From (2) we have that rt2 = {Xt − m (Xt−1                2         2
                                                   )} 2= σ (Xt−1 ) εt , such that
                                     2
its conditional expectation is E rt | Xt−1 = x = σ (x). This therefore shows
that it is natural to estimate σ 2 (x) using the estimated residuals. Consequently
the estimates of m(x) and σ 2 (x) are derived from the solutions of the following
minimization problems:

                         T
                         X                                      2
     aT (x) = arg min
     b                          {Xt − a1 − a2 (Xt−1 − x)} K ((Xt−1 − x) /h1T )
                a∈R2      t=1
                         T
                         X                                      2
                                 r̂t2 − b1 − b2 (Xt−1 − x)
                           
     bbT (x) = arg min                                              W ((Xt−1 − x) /h2T )
                b∈R2     t=1

   where K(·) and W (·) are the Kernel functions, h1T > 0 and h2T > 0 the

                                       b T (x)} the estimated residuals.
   The estimate of m(x) is given by mb T (x) = b            a1 where e = (1, 0)′
                                                aT (x)′ e = b
                                               2
such that the residuals are rbt2 = {Xt−1 − b
                                           a1 } which are used in the above
second minimization problem to obtain the estimator of σ 2 (x) given by

                                   bT2 (x) = bbT (x)′ e = bb1
                                   σ
     Fan & Yao (1998) demonstrate the asymptotic normality and efficiency of
bT2 (x), and apply their method to estimate the conditional mean and volatility
σ
functions to yields of the three-month Treasury Bill.
     The reason for using the local polynomial regression, especially the local lin-
ear estimator applied in the Hardle & Tsybakov (1997) and Fan & Yao (1998), is
because the local polynomial estimator has diverse statistical properties. Among
these are: Agreeable nice asymptotic properties such as asymptotic minimax ef-
ficiency (Fan 1993), good finite sampling and design-adaptation properties, and
it overcomes the drawbacks of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator and other non-
parametric estimators such as large biases due to boundary effects. See Fan
(1993), Fan & Gijbels (1996), and Fan & Yao (2005) for a complete derivation
and description of statistical properties of the local polynomial estimator.

    Note that the implementation of the above estimators depends on the appro-
priate selection of both bandwidth parameter and Kernel function. For example,
for local linear estimator, Hardle & Tsybakov (1997) applied the crossvalidation
method to choose the bandwidth parameter using the Quartic Kernel, and Fan
& Yao (1998) applied the data-driven bandwidth selection method using the
Epanechnikov Kernel. See Fan & Yao (2005) for a complete description of
bandwidth parameter selection methods for dependent processes.


4    Empirical Application for the COP/USD Ex-
     change Rate Returns
In this section we apply the previously described different nonparametric esti-
mators to estimate both the conditional mean and variance functions for the
COP/USD exchange rate returns, St , defined as Xt = log (St /St−1 ). The data
consists of 3515 commercial daily observations (from 2 January 1995-20 June
2008). There are two reasons for choosing this period. Firstly, the applied work
on COP/USD exchange rate usually studies this series without the exchange
rate band regime, and due to the nonparametric time series methods are very
effective in modeling potential nonlinearities (for example, due to interventions),
we consider that is important to use the whole period. Secondly, the estimation
and bandwidth selection methods are difficult unless the sample size is large
(Fan & Yao 2005, Fan & Gijbels 1996). The statistical source of the database
is the Central Bank of Colombia.
    The graphs of the COP/USD exchange rate, its returns and respectively
squared returns are presented in Figure 1. As we can see, the COP/USD ex-
change rate returns present the well-known cluster volatility phenomena. This is
related to the excess kurtosis as is ilustrated by the Kernel density estimation for
the COP/ USD exchange rate returns in Figure 1
    Figure 1: COP/USD exchange rate, COP/USD exchange rate returns, squared
COP/USD exchange rate returns, and Kernel density estimation for COP/USD
exchange rate returns compared with a mean zero normal density with standard
deviation, σb = 0.00524.
    To test for the existence of nonlinearity in the COP/USD returns and its
squares, we applied the popular BDS test (see Brock et al. 1996), which can be
considered a misspecification test in time series analysis. This test has power
against a wide range of linear and nonlinear alternatives. The results displayed
in Table 1 show that the null hypothesis of i.i.d. is rejected for most combina-
tions of m and ϵ for both variables. Since there appears to be no discernible
linear structure in the returns and its squares, the results suggest that there
may be a nonlinear structure.

    The Kernel function used in all estimations for both the conditional mean
and volatility functions was the Epanechnikov Kernel, given by K(u) = 34 (1−
u2 I(|u| ≤ 1). In addition, we developed all estimations by employing other
                                                                  2 2

ing the same kernel function for the conditional mean and volatility, we ob-
tained very similar results. For optimal bandwidth parameter selection, we
always choose it by applying the following bandwidth selection methods: cross-
validation, rule of thumb, the pre-asymptotic substitution method by Fan &
Gijbels (1995), and the plug-in approach. After the empirical comparison of
the estimations obtained by means of the different bandwidth selection meth-
ods, the optimal bandwidth parameters for the conditional mean were 0.0134
and 0.0140 to Nadaraya-Watson and local linear polynomial estimators, respec-
tively, and for the conditional variance were 0.0134, 0.0127, and 0.0149 to the
Nadaraya-Watson, Hardle & Tsybakov (1997), and Fan & Yao (1998) estima-
tors, respectively. All estimations and computations were carried out using
the Xplore software version 4.8 and the locpol R package developed by Cabr-
era (2008). We also applied a robust local polynomial regression proposed by
Cleveland (1979) to guard against deviant points (outliers) which may have had
a distorting effect on the smoothing. As the results were very similar, they have
not been illustrated to save space 4
    Figure 2 shows the scatterplots of Xt against Xt−1 , and the conditional
mean function estimated by (a) Nadaraya-Watson (local constant estimator),
and (b) local linear polynomial estimators denoted by m  b T (Xt−1 ). The dashed
lines correspond to pointwise 95% asymptotic confidence intervals 5 As we can
see, the shape of both estimate curves is almost equal, except for on the left
edge where there is a boundary effect in the local constant fit thus generating
bias problems in the lineal direction on the edges.

data.

    The most important segment in the graphs corresponds at the center: be-
tween -0.02 and 0.02 , because there in that interval are most of the observations,
and therefore more efficiency in the estimation of the conditional mean func-
tion. As we can see in that segment, the slope is almost zero which that possibly
means that an efficient exchange rate market exists. The results found in the
literature on exchange rate markets are diverse. Some show evidence of low neg-
ative slopes (mean reversion) (Hardle & Tsybakov 1997) and others low positive
slopes (Julio et al. 2005).
    The graphs of the estimated residuals, rbt = {Xt − m    b T (x)}, where mb T (x) is
the estimated conditional mean function obtained from the local linear polyno-
mial estimation, and its squares, rbt2 , are illustrated in Figure 3. The latter is
employed in the estimation for the conditional variance function using the local
linear estimator of Fan & Yao (1998). Additionally the scatterplot between rbt
against Xt−1 , including the estimated conditional mean curve, and the Kernel
density estimation for residuals compared with a mean zero normal density with
standard deviation, σ b = 0.00524 are shown in Figure 3 .
    Figures 4 (a) and 4 (b) depict the scatterplots of the squared returns, Xt2 ,
against Xt−1 , and the estimated regression curve of the conditional variance,
denoted by σ bT2 (Xt−1 ), estimated by the Nadaraya-Watson and the local linear
estimator by Hardle & Tsybakov (1997). Figure 4 (c) shows the scatterplot of
the squared residuals, rbt , against Xt−1 , and the local linear estimator of Fan &
Yao (1998).
    Figure 5 shows the volatility functions, σ    bT (Xt−1 ), estimated by (a) the
Nadaraya-Watson, (b) the Hardle & Tsybakov (1997), and (c) the Fan & Yao
(1998) estimators. The results show that the conditional volatility function es-
timated by means of the Fan and Yao residual-based local linear estimator is
smoother than the local constant and linear estimators using the squared re-
turns.

density estimation for residuals compared to a mean zero normal density with

    Furthermore, the results do not to show evidence of volatility asymmetries.
On the contrary, the well-known U-shape in the conditional volatility function
(except to the Fan and Yao’s estimator) is present. This result concurs with
findings in other studies that employ the parametric approach (Castaño et al.
2008, Maya & Gómez 2008). This indicates, for example, that it is proper
to carry out an option evaluation on the COP/USD exchange rate with the
symmetric volatility "smile". However, this symmetric U-shape is particularly
clear in the central area of the graphs where the majority of observations are,
this is, in the segment between -0.02 and 0.02 (see Figure 3). As expected,
this symmetry in volatility is broken due to boundary effects on the right and
left edges where there are few observations for correct smoothing (Hardle 1990,
Hardle & Tsybakov 1997, Fan & Gijbels 1996, Hardle et al. 2004).
    Finally, the results are along the lines of the findings by Julio et al. (2005),

who applied the local lineal polynomial regression 6 The goal of their study
was to determine the features of the "volatility U-shape" and mean response
functions, and the market effect of central bank interventions on those functions.
They found that "discretional interventions" tend to change the concavity of the
"volatility Ushape". However, that change was moderated and it never produced
"volatility skew".

5     Conclusions
The role of volatility associated with a stochastic process is well-known, partic-
ularly in economics and finance. However, most of the volatility models have
focused their attention on the parametric approach to represent the stochastic
dynamic properties of the data generating process, assuming explicit functional
forms for the mean and variance processes. In this paper a nonparametric time
series analysis to the conditional mean and variance functions was carried out
on the Colombian Peso/US Dollar -COP/USD- exchange rate returns.
    Two nonparametric estimators were applied to estimate the conditional mean
function: the local constant polynomial (Nadaraya-Watson) and local linear
polynomial estimators; whereas three were used for the conditional variance
function: the local constant and linear estimators based on the squared returns
and the residual-based local linear estimator. The results show no evidence of
asymmetries in the volatility of COP/USD exchange rate. On the contrary, we
found the "volatility U-shape". Additionally, the results indicate that there is
mean reversion according to the existence of a lineal function relationship to
conditional mean.
    Finally, as Bossaerts et al. (1995) point out, the nonparametric analysis can
be extended considering a less restricted data generating process on the condi-
tional mean function as well as on the conditional variance function including
more lags
   6 In their study they used a different sample, from September 27th 1999-March 31st 2005.

Additionally, they fit a local linear approximation to conditional mean and local quadratic
approximation to conditional variance.

sionality" problem. Moreover, other nonparametric models can be attempted;
for instance the Functional-Coefficient Autoregressive model, the Additive Au-
toregressive model, and among others. At this moment this extension is been
performed jointly with a multivariate analysis to modeling portfolios of exchange
rates and forecast future returns over short horizons.
