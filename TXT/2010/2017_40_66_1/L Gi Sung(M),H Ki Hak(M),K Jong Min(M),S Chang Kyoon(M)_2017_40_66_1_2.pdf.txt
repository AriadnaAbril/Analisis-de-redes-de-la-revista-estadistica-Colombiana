Abstract
This paper suggests a stratified Kuk model to estimate the proportion of sensitive attributes of a population composed by a number of strata; this is undertaken by applying stratified sampling to the adjusted Kuk model. The paper estimates sensitive parameters when the size of the stratum is known by taking proportional and optimal allocation methods into account and then extends to the case of an unknown stratum size, estimating sensitive parameters by applying stratified double sampling and checking the two allocation methods. Finally, the paper compares the efficiency of the proposed model to that of the Su, Sedory and Singh model and the adjusted Kuk model in terms of the estimator variance.
Key words: Adjusted Kuk Model, Randomized Response Model, Sensitive Attribute, Stratified Double Sampling, Stratified Sampling.
Resumen
Este trabajo propone un modelo Kuk estratificado para estimar la proporción de atributos sensibles de una población compuesta por varios estratos mediante la aplicación de un muestreo estratificado al modelo Kuk ajustado. El trabajo estima parámetros sensibles en el caso en que el tamaño del estrato es conocido mediante la adopción de métodos de asignación proporcionales y óptimos, y se extiende al caso de un tamaño de estrato desconocido, estimando parámetros sensibles mediante la aplicación de un doble muestreo estratificado y la comprobación de los dos métodos de asignación. Por último, el trabajo compara la eficiencia del modelo propuesto a la del modelo de Su, Sedory y Singh y el modelo Kuk ajustado en términos de la varianza del estimador.
Palabras clave: modelo Kuk ajustado, modelo de respuesta aleatorizada, atributos sensibles, muestreo doble estratificado, muestreo estratificado.



1. Introduction
   Warner (1965) was the first person to suggest an ingenious survey model called
the randomized response model (RRM) to obtain sensitive information from re-
spondents without disturbing their privacy by using a randomization device that
contained the following two questions (a sensitive question and a nonsensitive one):
Q1:Do you have a sensitive attribute A? (with probability P ),
Q2:Do you have a nonsensitive attribute Ac ? (with probability (1 − P ).
     The probability of a “yes” answer is given by
                             ∗
                            θW = P π + (1 − P )(1 − π).                                 (1)

          ∗
   Let nθ̂W  be the number of “yes” responses in a sample of size n respondents,
and then the estimator π̂W and the variance V (π̂W ) of its sensitive proportion π
are respectively
                                    ∗

    Kuk (1990) suggested an RR model that makes use of two randomization de-
vices. The first randomization device R1 is composed of a deck of cards, and each
card bears one of two possible questions with two possible outcomes:
Q1:Do you have a sensitive attribute A? (with probability θ1 ).
Q2:Do you have a nonsensitive attribute Ac ? (with probability 1 − θ1 ).
   The second randomization device R2 is composed of a deck of cards, and each
card bears one of two possible questions with two possible outcomes:
Q1:Do you have a nonsensitive attribute Ac ? (with probability θ2 ).
Q2:Do you have a sensitive attribute A? (with probability 1 − θ2 ).
   Assume that a simple random sample with the replacement (SRSWR) of n
respondents is selected from the population of interest. Each respondent is to

report the first outcome of R1 if he or she has a sensitive attribute A and the
second outcome of R2 if he or she has no sensitive attribute A. The probability of
                 ∗
a “yes” answer θK  is given by
                             ∗
                            θK = πθ1 + (1 − π)θ2 .                                    (4)

          ∗
   Let nθ̂K  denote the number of “yes” responses in the sample of size n, and then
the estimator π̂K of π, the proportion of the population in the sensitive group,
and its variance V (π̂K ) are given by
                                     ∗
                                   θ̂K − θ2
                           π̂K =            , θ1 6= θ2 ,                              (5)

    Many studies have suggested and extended various models based on Warner’s
model. Chaudhuri & Mukerjee (1988) and Ryu, Hong & Lee (1993) organize and
emphasize various RR models. Kim & Warde (2004) present a stratified RR model
by using an optimal allocation method, and Kim & Elam (2005) extend it to a
two-stage stratified RR model. Recently Chaudhuri (2015) summrizes the history
of RRM, Tarray & Singh (2015) suggest the Poisson RRM for a rare sentitive
attribute. Also, Su, Sedory & Singh (2015) suggest a new RR model compelling
answers “yes” or “no” to each respondent according to his or her selection situation
in a randomization device modified from Kuk’s randomization device. However, Su
et al. (2015) model estimates sensitive attributes by using simple random sampling,
and therefore it is difficult to apply it to populations composed of several strata.
    This paper considers the conditions to estimate the proportion of sensitive at-
tributes of a population composed by a number of strata and extends the adjusted
Kuk model by applying stratified sampling. The paper estimates sensitive pa-
rameters in the case of a known stratum size by taking proportional and optimal
allocation methods into account. It then extends it to the case of an unknown stra-
tum size by estimating sensitive parameters by applying stratified double sampling
to the Su, Sedory, and Singh model and checking the two allocation methods. Fi-
nally, the paper compares the efficiency of the proposed model to that of the Su,
Sedory and Singh model and the stratified Kuk model in terms of the estimator
variance.


2. An RR Model Using a Modified Kuk’s
   Randomization Device
    Su et al. (2015) estimate the proportion of sensitive attributes by suggesting
an adjusted RR model that modified Kuk’s. The modified Kuk model suggested
in Su et al. (2015) applies the modified Kuk’s randomization device to respondents
selected by simple random sampling with replacement (SRSWR).

    Each respondent in a sample of n respondents is provided with two randomiza-
tion devices D1 and D2 . The randomization device D1 consists of a deck of cards,
and each card bears one of the following two statements: (1) use the randomiza-
tion device F1 and (2) use the randomization device F1c with probabilities θ1 and
(1 − θ1 ), respectively. Similarly, the randomization device D2 consists of a deck of
cards, and each card bears one of the following two statements: (1) use the ran-
domization device F2 and (2) use the randomization device F2c with probabilities
θ2 and (1 − θ2 ), respectively. Each respondent is instructed to use the first device
D1 if he or she has the sensitive attribute A and the second device D2 if he or she
has the nonsensitive attribute Ac . The device F1 mentioned in the first outcome
of the device D1 consists of two possible mutually exclusive statements: (1) say
“yes” and (2) say “no” with probabilities P1 and (1 − P1 ), respectively. The device
F1c mentioned in the second outcome of the device D1 also consists of two possible
mutually exclusive statements: (1) say “yes” and (2) say “no” with probabilities T1
and (1 − T1 ), respectively. Similarly, the device F2 mentioned in the first outcome
of the device D2 consists of two possible mutually exclusive statements: (1) say
“yes” and (2) say “no” with probabilities P2 and (1 − P2 ), respectively. The device
F2c mentioned in the second outcome of the device D2 also consists of two possible
mutually exclusive statements: (1) say “yes” and (2) say “no” but with probabilities
T2 and (1 − T2 ), respectively.
     In the adjusted Kuk RR model, the probability of a “yes” answer is given by

        θc∗ = π [θ1 P1 + (1 − θ1 )T1 ] + (1 − π) [θ2 P2 + (1 − θ2 )T2 ]
                                                                                         (7)
           = π [θ1 (P1 − T1 ) − θ2 (P2 − T2 ) + (T1 − T2 )] + θ2 P2 + (1 − θ2 )T2 ,

where π is the population proportion of sensitive attributes.
     The estimator πˆc of the population proportion of sensitive attributes is

                                   θ̂c∗ − θ2 P2 − (1 − θ2 )T2
                  π̂c =                                               ,                  (8)
                           θ1 (P1 − T1 ) − θ2 (P2 − T2 ) + (T1 − T2 )

where θ̂c∗ = x/n is the observed proportion of “yes” answers.
     The variance of the proposed estimator πˆc is given as follows:
                                            θc∗ (1 − θc∗ )
              V (π̂c ) =                                                  2.             (9)

3. A Stratified Kuk Randomization Device
    This section considers the estimation of the proportion of sensitive attributes
by using a stratified Kuk randomization device and checks the allocation method
when the population consists of a number of strata and the size of each stratum
is known. Let the population of size N be divided into disjointed
                                                            PL     L strata of size
Nh (h = 1, 2, . . . , L) each in the stratum h. Then nh (n = h=1 nh ) respondents
are selected by the SRSWR and asked to answer “yes” or “no” according to the
modified Kuk randomization device.

    Each respondent in stratum h is provided with two randomization devices
Dh1 and Dh2 . The randomization device Dh1 consists of a deck of cards, and
each card bears one of the following two statements: (1) use the randomization

device Fh1 and (2) use randomization device Fh1      with probabilities θh1 and (1 −
θh1 ), respectively. Similarly, the randomization device Dh2 consists of a deck of
cards, and here each card bears one of the following two statements: (1) use
                                                                              c
the randomization device Fh2 and (2) use the randomization device Fh2           with
probabilities θh2 and (1 − θh1 ), respectively. Each respondent in stratum h is
instructed to use the first device Dh1 if he or she has the sensitive attribute Ah
and the second device Dh2 if he or she has no sensitive attribute Ah . The device
Fh1 mentioned in the first outcome Dh1 consists of two possible mutually exclusive
statements: (1) say “yes” and (2) say “no” with probabilities Ph1 and (1 − Ph1 ),
                              c
respectively. The device Fh1     mentioned in the second outcome Dh1 consists of
two possible mutually exclusive statements: (1) say “yes” and (2) say “no” with
probabilities Th1 and (1 − Th1 ), respectively. Similarly, the device Fh2 mentioned
in the first outcome Dh2 consists of two possible mutually exclusive statements:
(1) say “yes” and (2) say “no” with probabilities Ph2 and (1 − Ph2 ), respectively.
                c
The device Fh2     mentioned in the second outcome Dh2 consists of two possible
mutually exclusive statements: (1) say “yes” and (2) say “no” with probabilities
Th2 and (1 − Th2 ), respectively. A pictorial representation of this forced RR model
is given in Figure 1.

   From these RR procedures, the probability of a “yes” answer is given by

that is, B(nh , θhc ). Therefore, the probability of observing xh “yes” answers out

The log-likelihood function is given by

gives the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) θ̂hc of θhc as follows:

Therefore, the estimator π̂hc of the population proportion of sensitive attributes
in stratum h is

    Now, consider proportional and optimal allocation methods to allocate the
overall sample of n to each stratum of nh and check the variance in each case. In
stratified sampling, values of sample sizes nh in respective strata are chosen by
the sampler. If the stratum size Nh is known but the variance of each stratum
is not known, then the proportional allocation method is useful. In proportional
allocation, nh = n(Nh /N ), and the variance of π̂st is given by
                       L                      ∗        ∗

   The optimal allocation method determines nh to minimize V (π̂st ) for a specified
cost or the cost of a specified value of V (π̂st ). Let the cost function be
                                                       L

4. Stratified Double Estimation of Sensitive
   Attributes Using a Stratified Kuk Randomization
   Device
    This section considers the estimation of the proportion of sensitive attributes
by using a stratified Kuk randomization device and checks the allocation method
when the population consists of a number of strata but there is no information
on the size of each stratum. If there is a lack of information on stratum size in
stratified sampling, then stratified double sampling is useful. If there is a lack of
information on stratum size, then it can be obtained from the first sample, and
the estimation of sensitive attributes can be made by using the stratified Kuk
randomization device. If a population of size N consists of L strata, then the first
sample of n0 respondents is selected by the SRSWR, and they are asked to directy
answer the question “Are you in stratum?”. Then the first sample is classified into
h strata of size n0h , and two proportions Wh and wh are defined as follows:

        Nh
    Wh =     : The proportion of the population falling into stratum h,
         N
        n0
    wh = h0 : The proportion of the first sample falling into stratum h.
         n
where wh is an unbiased estimator of Wh for h = 1, 2, . . . , L.
                                                                         PL
   The second sample is a stratified sample in stratum h. Here nh (n = h=1 nh )
respondents are selected by the SRSWR from the first sample n0h ; they are then
asked to answer “yes” or “no” according to the stratified Kuk randomization device,
as in Section 2. The stratified estimator π̂std of the population proportion of
sensitive attributes can be obtained from these procedures as follows:
             L                      ∗
             X                    θ̂hc − θh2 Ph2 − (1 − θh2 )Th2                 n0
   π̂std =         wh                                                      , wh = h0 .    (20)

             h=1

Theorem 4. The stratified estimator π̂std is an unbiased estimator of π.

Proof . If π̂h0 is written as an estimator of sensitive attributes obtained from the
first sample n0h of the stratum h and π̂std is redefined as a function of π̂h0 , then
π̂std can be expressed as follows:

because nh = vh n0h = vh wh n0 .
   Here (21) is obtained from these equations.

    Now consider proportional and optimal allocation methods to allocate the over-
all sample of n to each stratum of n0h and check the variance in each case. If the
stratum size Nh is known but the variance of each stratum is not known, then the
proportional allocation method is useful. In the proportional allocation method,
if n0 and n0h are used instead of N and Nh , then nh = n(n0h /n0 ) and the variance
of π̂std(p) is given by

   The optimal allocation method determines n0 and vh to minimize V (π̂std ) for
a specified cost. Let the cost function be

where c0 is the total cost for the first sample and ch is the cost per unit.
    Then the expected value of (23) must be minimized to obtain optimum values
of n0 and vh because nh is a random variable. The expected value of C is given by

     Substituting vh into (24) gives the optimum value of n0 as follows:

5. Efficiency Comparison

     Estimation
    In the Su et al. (2015) model, the variance of the estimator π̂c of the sensitive
attribute π is

                            n [θ1 (P1 − T1 ) − θ2 (P2 − T2 ) + (T1 − T2 )]

where θc∗ = π[θ1 (P1 − T1 ) − θ2 (P2 − T2 ) + (T1 − T2 )] + θ2 P2 + (1 − θ2 )T2 .
     Here the relative efficiency used (RE) to compare the efficiency of two models:

    Values of RE greater than 1 indicate that the estimator obtained using the

   Based on Table 1, if P1 = P2 = 0.7 and T2 = T12 = T22 = 0.7 , then the
percentage of RE > 1 is 20.79%, and if T2 = T12 = T22 = 0.7, then the percentage
of RE > 1 is 20.02%. In the case of some fixed P1 = P2 = 0.7, if T1 , T2 increase
from 0.7 to 0.9, then the percentage of RE > 1 increases. However, if P1 , P2
or T1 , T2 increase from 0.7 to 0.9, then the percentage of RE > 1 decreases. In
addition, if selection probabilities P1 , P2 and T1 , T2 have the same value, then the
percentage of RE > 1, that is, that of diagonal cells, will have the lowest value of
any other off-diagonal cells.
   Figures 2 and 3 show that section probabilities P1 = P2 = 0.7 to 0.9 and
T2 = T12 = T22 = 0.7 to 0.9 for each stratum reduce the percentage of RE > 1. If
π = π1 = π2 = 0.2 or 0.3, the percentage of RE > 1 has the same pattern as that

in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 4 shows that RE > 1 increases for π = π1 = π2 = 0.1 to
0.3 and decreases for π = π1 = π2 = 0.7 to 0.9 for strata sizes W1 = 0.7, W2 = 0.3
and W1 = 0.6, W2 = 0.4, respectively. In addition, the percentage of RE > 1 if
W1 = 0.7, W2 = 0.3 are greater than W1 = 0.6, W2 = 0.4. That is, if the size of the
stratum varies across strata, then the relative efficiency of the proposed estimator
is more efficient than Su et al.’s (2015) estimator.

5.2. Stratified Estimation vs. Stratified Double Estimation
   The difference between (16), the variance of the stratified estimator, and (22):
the variance of the stratified double estimator, is
                                 L
                             1 X
                                 Wh (π̂h − π)2 .                                   (29)
                             n0
                                h=1

The increment of the variance in stratified double sampling is due to an unknown
stratum size obtained in the process of forming an estimator.


6. Conclusions
    This paper estimate sensitive attributes of a population composed of a number
of strata by applying stratified sampling to the Su, Sedory and Singh model. The
paper estimates sensitive parameters in the case where stratum size is known by
taking proportional and optimal allocation methods into account; this is then to
the case of an unknown stratum size, for which sensitive parameters are estimated
by applying stratified double sampling to the modified Kuk model and the two
allocation methods are checked. The paper compares the efficiency of the pro-
posed stratified Kuk model to that of the Su, Sedory and Singh model in terms of
estimator variance. The results of the numerical study indicate that the proposed
estimator is more efficient than the Su, Sedory and Singh model for different sizes
of strata. In the proposed model, RE > 1 is guaranteed to be more than 35% in
all cases with various parameters.
