Abstract
This article addresses various properties and different methods of estimation of the unknown Transmuted Rayleigh (TR) distribution parameters from a frequentist point of view. Although our main focus is on estimation, various mathematical and statistical properties of the TR distribution (such as quantiles, moments, moment generating function, conditional moments, hazard rate, mean residual lifetime, mean past lifetime, mean deviation about mean and median, the stochastic ordering, various entropies, stress-strength parameter, and order statistics) are derived. We briefly describe different methods of estimation such as maximum likelihood, method of moments, percentile based estimation, least squares, method of maximum product of spacings, method of Cramér-von-Mises, methods of AndersonDarling and right-tail Anderson-Darling, and compare them using extensive simulations studies. Finally, the potentiality of the model is studied using two real data sets. Bias, standard error of the estimates, and bootstrap percentile confidence intervals are obtained by bootstrap resampling.

1. Introduction
    Rayleigh distribution was introduced by Rayleigh (1880) and relates to a prob-
lem in the field of acoustics. This distribution has been extensively used in various
fields such as communication engineering, the life-testing of electro vacuum devices,
reliability theory, and survival analysis. An important characteristic of this distri-
bution is that its failure rate is a linear function of time. The reliability function
of the Rayleigh distribution decreases at a much higher rate than the reliability
function of exponential distribution. This distribution relates to a number of dis-
tributions such as generalized extreme value, Weibull and Chi-square distributions
and, hence, its applicability in real life situations is significant. Estimations, pre-
dictions, and inferential issues for one parameter Rayleigh distributions have been
extensively studied by several authors. Interested readers may refer to Johnson,
Kotz & Balakrishnan (1995) for on excellent insight into the Rayleigh distribution,
and also see Dey & Das (2007), Dey (2009) for some references.
    The construction of the transmuted distribution is rather simple and was
first proposed by Shaw & Buckley (2007). Since then, transmuted distributions
have been widely studied in statistics, and many authors have developed various
transmuted-type distributions based on some well known distributions. See, for
example, the transmuted extreme value distribution with applications by Alkasas-
beh & Raqab (2009a); the transmuted Lindley distribution by Merovci (2013b);
the transmuted generalized Rayleigh distribution by Merovci (2013a); the trans-
muted exponentiated exponential distribution by Merovci (2013c); the transmuted
Fréchet distribution by Mahmoud & Mandouh (2013); the transmuted generalized
inverse Weibull distribution by Merovci, Elbatal & Ahmed (2014); the transmuted

Estimation of Transmuted Rayleigh distribution                                     167

Linear exponential distribution by Tian, Tian & Zhu (2014); and the transmuted
Pareto distribution by Merovci & Puka (2014), etc. Hence, efficient estimation of
these parameters is extremely important.
    We know that the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the method of
moments estimation (MME) are traditional methods of estimation. Although MLE
is advantageous in terms of its efficiency and has good theoretical properties, there
is evidence that it does not perform well, especially in the case of small samples.
The method of moments is easily applicable and often gives explicit forms for
estimators of unknown parameters. There are, however, cases where the method of
moments does not give explicit estimators (e.g., for the parameters of the Weibull
and Gompertz distributions). Therefore, other methods have been proposed in
the literature as alternatives to the traditional methods of estimation. Among
them, the L-moments estimator (LME), least squares estimator (LSE), generalized
spacing estimator (GSE), and percentile estimator (PCE) are often suggested.
Generally, these methods do not have good theoretical properties, but in some
cases they can provide better estimates of the unknown parameters than the MLE
and the MME. This paper considers ten different frequentist estimators for the
transmuted Rayleigh distribution and evaluates their performance for different
sample sizes and different parameter values. Simulations are used to compare the
performance as it is not possible to compare all estimators theoretically (see Gupta
& Kundu 2001, Gupta & Kundu 2007).
    The uniqueness of this study comes from the fact that we provide a comprehen-
sive description of the mathematical and statistical properties of this distribution
with the hope that they will attract wider applications in lifetime analysis. Also,
to the best of our knowledge thus far, no attempt has been made to compare all
these estimators to the two-parameter TR distribution along with mathematical
and statistical properties. Comparisons of estimation methods for other distribu-
tions have been performed in the literature: Kundu & Raqab (2005) for generalized
Rayleigh distributions, Alkasasbeh & Raqab (2009b) for generalized logistic distri-
butions, Mazucheli, Louzada & Ghitany (2013) for weighted Lindley distribution,
Teimouri, Hoseini & Nadarajah (2013) for the Weibull distribution, Akram &
Hayat (2014) for Weibull distribution, and Dey, Dey & Kundu (2014) for two-
parameter Rayleigh distribution. There are some works found in the literature
on transmuted Rayleigh distribution and its variants such as the slashed Rayleigh
distribution Iriarte, Gómez, Varela & Bolfarine (2015) and its exponential variant
Salinas, Iriarte & Bolfarine (2015).
   The transmuted Rayleigh (TR) distribution was introduced by Merovci (2013c).
He only studied moments and the maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown
parameters.
   A random variable X is said to have a transmuted Rayleigh distribution if its
cumulative distribution function(cdf) is given by

    The distribution studied in this paper is a re-parameterization of the the version
proposed by Merovci (2013c) with α = (2σ 2 )−1 . Note that the classical Rayleigh
distribution is a special case for λ = 0. Figure 1 illustrates some of the possible
shapes of the pdf of a transmuted Rayleigh distribution for selected values of the
parameters λ and α. This distribution has a unimodal pdf and increasing hazard
rates. The latter may seem unrealistic at first in real life situation. However,
in several situations, only increasing hazard rates are used or observed: Maeda
& Nishikawa (2006) state that “Ruling parties in presidential systems face an
increasing hazard rate in their survival”; Woosley & Cossman (2007) observe that
drugs during clinical development have increasing hazard rates; Saidane, Babai,
Aguir & Korbaa (2010) suppose that the demand interval in spare parts inventory
systems has increasing hazard rates; Tsarouhas & Arvanitoyannis (2007) show that
machines involved in bread production display increasing hazard rates; Koutras
(2011) finds that software degradation times have increasing hazard rates; and
Lai (2013) investigates the optimum number of minimal repairs for systems under
increasing hazard rates; etc.

    The principal motivation of the paper is two fold: one is empirical and shows
that the studied transmuted Rayleigh distribution outperforms at least two two-
parameter distributions with respect to a real data set; the other is to show how
different frequentist estimators of this distribution perform for different sample
sizes and different parameter values, and to develop a guideline to choose the
best estimation method for the transmuted Rayleigh distribution, which we think
would be of interest to applied statisticians.
    The paper is organized as follows: Various mathematical, statistical and relia-
bility properties of the TR distribution (like shapes, quantiles, moments, moment

generating function, hazard rate function, mean residual lifetime, and conditional
moments, etc.) are derived in Sections 1 and 2. In Section 3, ten most frequent
methods of estimations are discussed. Inference with simulation and two real data
applications for the TR distribution are discussed in Section 4 and 5. In the last
section, we draw some conclusions about the information contained in this article.


1.1. Shape
  The study of shapes is useful to determine if a data set can be modeled by the
TR distribution. Here, we discuss the shapes of the pdf g.

Theorem 1. The probability density function, g, is unimodal.

Proof . Notice that g is a smooth function. To prove it is unimodal, we shall first
show that there is one and only one x∗ ∈ R+ , such that g 0 (x∗ ) = 0, and g 0 > 0 for
                                              2
x < x∗ & g 0 < 0 for x > x∗ . Letting u = e−αx , we have

                 g 0 (x) = 2αe−2u [eu (λ − 1)(2u − 1) + (2 − 8u)λ] .

   Since 0 < u < ∞, g 0 >, =, < 0 depends on whether eu (λ − 1)(2u − 1) + (2 −
8u)λ >, =, < 0, respectively. Now g 0 (x) = 0 implies that

                        eu (λ − 1)(2u − 1) + (2 − 8u)λ = 0.

Case I: (λ = 1.) This implies u∗ = 1/4, and hence x∗ = 2√1 α .
   Now, for x > x∗ , i.e. u∗ > 1/4, we have eu (λ−1)(2u−1)+(2−8u)λ = 2−8u < 0
and, hence, g 0 < 0. Similarly, for x < x∗ we obtain g 0 > 0.
                                                          u
Case II: (λ 6= 1.) In this case, we have Q(u) := (2u−1)e
                                                    8u−2   = λ−1 λ
                                                                    . Note that Q is a
                                                     1         1               λ
strictly increasing, continuous function of u on (0, 4 ) and ( 4 , ∞). Since λ−1 ≤ 12
                     1           1                           1
and Q has range ( 2 , ∞) on (0, 4 ) and range (−∞, ∞) on ( 2 , ∞), there is a unique
u∗ ∈ ( 14 , ∞) such that Q(u∗ ) = λ−1
                                   λ
                                      . Hence there is a unique x∗ > 2√1 α such that
g 0 (x∗ ) = 0.
   Now, for u > u∗ > 1/4, 1/4 < u < u∗ and 0 < u < 1/4 < u∗ , one can easily
show that g 0 < 0, > 0 and > 0, respectively. Hence g is unimodal.


2. Statistical and Mathematical Properties
    In this section, we provide some important statistical and mathematical mea-
sures for the TR distribution such as quantiles, moment generating functions,
moments, hazard rate and mean residual life functions, mean past lifetime, con-
ditional moments, Stochastic ordering, mean deviation about mean and median,
Shannon and Rényi entropy, order statistics, and stress strength parameters.
    The quantile function x = Q(p) = G−1 (p), for 0 < p < 1, of the TR distribution
is obtained from (1); it follows that the quantile function is

In particular, the median of the TR distribution can be written as

                                            "                    √      !# 12

We hardly need to emphasize the necessity and importance of the moments in
any statistical analysis, especially in applied work. Some of the most important
features and characteristics of a distribution can be studied through moments
(e.g., tendency, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis). If the random variable X is
distributed T R(α, λ), then its nth moment around zero can be expressed as
                               Z ∞
                n
                                     xn+1 exp −αx2         1 − λ + 2λ exp −αx2
                                                                                 
           E(X ) = 2α                                                                  dx.
                               0

      On simplification, we get
                                                      n                 
                       E(X n ) = α−n/2 Γ(1 +            ) 1 − λ + λ2−n/2                       (6)
                                                      2
The variance, skewness, and kurtosis measures can now be calculated using the
following relations

              V ar(X) = E(X 2 ) − E 2 (X),

                               E(X 3 ) − 3E(X)E(X 2 ) + 2E 3 (X)
         Skewness(X) =                                           ,
                                          V ar3/2 (X)

                               E(X 4 ) − 4E(X)E(X 3 ) + 6E(X 2 )E 2 (X) − 3E 4 (X)
         Kurtosis(X) =                                                             .
                                                 V ar2 (X)

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate their variations.


2.1. Moment Generating Function
   Many of the interesting characteristics and features of a distribution can be
obtained via its moment generating function and moments. Let X denote a random
variable with the probability density function (2). By definition of the moment
generating function of X and using (2), we have
                       Z ∞

2.2. Stochastic Ordering
     Stochastic ordering is a tool used to study structural properties of complex
stochastic systems. For example, it is useful to control congestion in information-
transfer over the Internet, to define treatment-related trends in clustered binary
data, and order expected welfare income under different mechanisms of allocating
rewards. There are different types of stochastic orderings, which are useful in
ordering random variables in terms of different properties. Here we consider four
different stochastic orders, namely, the usual, the hazard rate, the mean residual
life, and the likelihood ratio order for two independent TR random variables under
a restricted parameter space. If Xand Y are independent random variables with
CDFs FX and FY , respectively, then X is said to be smaller than Y in the

   • hazard rate order (X ≤hr Y ) if hX (x) ≥ hY (x) for all x

   • mean residual life order (X ≤mrl Y ) if mX (x) ≥ mY (x) for all x

   • likelihood ratio order (X ≤lr Y ) if ffX (x)

                                                  decreases in x.

    The following results due to Shaked & Shanthikumar (1994) are well known
for establishing stochastic ordering of distributions.

                      X ≤lr Y =⇒ X         ≤hr   Y =⇒ X ≤mrl Y                         (8)

The TR is ordered with respect to the strongest “likelihood ratio” ordering as
shown in the following theorem. It shows the flexibility of the two parameter TR
distribution.

Theorem 2. Let X∼ T R (α1 , λ1 ) and Y∼ T R (α2 , λ2 ). If α1 = α2 = α and
λ1 ≥ λ2 , then X ≤lr Y and, hence, X ≤hr Y, X ≤mrl Y and X ≤st Y.

Proof . The likelihood ratio is
                                                2                     2
                           fX (x)   α1 xe−α1 x (1 − λ1 + 2λ1 e−α1 x )

                           fY (x)   α2 xe−α2 x2 (1 − λ2 + 2λ2 e−α2 x2 )
                                                                          2

             Thus,      log        = −2(α1 − α2 )x −
                     dx     fY (x)                   (1 − λ1 + 2λ1 e−α1 x2 )
                                                       2
                                         4α2 xλ2 e−α2 x
                                   +                         .

Now, if α1 = α2 = α and λ1 ≥ λ2 , then dx log ffX (x)
                                                Y (x)
                                                      ≤ 0, which implies that
X ≤lr Y and, hence, X ≤hr Y, X ≤mrl Y and X ≤st Y.


2.3. Hazard Function
      The hazard rate function of the transmuted Rayleigh distribution is given by
                                                                  2
                                  f (x)     2αx(1 − λ + 2λe−αx )
                       h(x) =             =                      .                     (9)
                                1 − F (x)     (1 − λ + λe−αx2 )

    Figure 4 illustrates some of the possible shapes of h. Even though, in Figure
4, it apparently looks like that the hazard rate function of the TR distribution
is always increasing, it can be noted that for some parameter values, the hazard
function decreases. For example if α = 0.2 and λ = 0.92, h decreases in the interval
(4, 4.4).

the item has survived to time x. Figure 5 illustrates some of the possible shapes

2.5. Mean Past Lifetime (MPL)
   In a real life situation, where systems are often not monitored continuously,
one might be interested in inferring more about the history of the system e.g.

when the individual components have failed. Now assume that a component with
lifetime X has failed at or some time before x, x ≥ 0. Consider the conditional
random variable x − X | X ≤ x. This conditional random variable shows, in fact,
the time elapsed from the failure of the component, given that its lifetime is less
than or equal to x. Hence, the mean past lifetime (MPL) of the component can

spread in a population. Let µ = E(X) and M be the mean and the median of the
transmuted Rayleigh distribution, respectively. The mean deviations about the
mean and of the median can be calculated as

2.8. Entropies
    An entropy provides an excellent tool to quantify the amount of information (or
uncertainty) contained in a random observation regarding its parent distribution
(population). A large value of entropy implies greater uncertainty in the data.
The concept of entropy is important in different areas such as physics, probability
and statistics, communication theory, and economics, etc. Several measures of
entropy have been studied and compared in the literature. If X has the probability,
distribution function f (·) then the Shannon entropy Shannon (1948) is defined by
           H(x) = −E (ln g(x))

2.9. Order Statistics
    Moments of order statistics play an important role in quality control testing
and reliability to predict the failure of future items based on the times of few early
failures. Thus, the kth order statistic of a sample is its kth smallest value. For a
sample of size n, the nth order statistic (or largest order statistic) is the maximum,
that is,
                              X(n) = max{X1 , . . . , Xn }.

The sample range is the difference between the maximum and minimum. It is
clearly a function of the order statistics:

                           range{X1 , . . . , Xn } = X(n) − X(1) .

We know that if X(1) ≤ · · · ≤ X(n) denotes the order statistic of a random sample
X1 , . . . , Xn from a continuous population with cdf GX (x) and pdf gX (x), then the
pdf of X(j) is given by

                               n!                        j−1              n−j
          gX(j) (x) =                    gX (x) (GX (x))     (1 − GX (x))     ,
                        (j − 1)!(n − j)!

for j = 1, . . . , n. The pdf of the jth order statistic for a transmuted Rayleigh
distribution is given by

2.11. Stress Strength Parameter
    In reliability theory, the stress-strength model describes the life of a compo-
nent or item which has a random strength X1 that is subjected to a random stress
X2 . The component fails instantaneously when the stress applied to it surpasses

the strength, and the component will function satisfactorily/acceptably whenever
X1 > X2 . So, R = P r (X1 > X2 ) is a measure of component reliability. Its appli-
cability is found in many spheres especially in engineering fields such as structures,
deterioration of rocket motors, fatigue failure of aircraft structures, and the ag-
ing of concrete pressure vessels, etc. Extensive work on estimation of reliability
of stress-strength models has been undertaken for the well known standard dis-
tributions. However, there are still some distributions (including generalizations
of the well-known distributions) for which the form of R has not been investi-
gated. Here, we derive the reliability R when X1 and X2 are independent random
variables distributed with parameters (α1 , λ1 ) and (α2 , λ2 ) , then

3. Methods of Estimation
    In this section, we describe ten methods to estimate the parameters, α and
λ, the TR distribution. We assume throughout that x = (x1 , · · · xn ) is a random
sample of size n from the TR distribution; both parameters α and λ are unknown.



3.1. Method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation

    The ML method is the most frequently used method of parameter estimation
(Casella & Berger 1990). Its success stems from its many desirable properties
including consistency, asymptotic efficiency, invariance property as well as its in-
tuitive appeal. Let x1 , . . . , xn be a random sample of size n from (2), the likelihood
function of the density (2) is given by

The MLE θ̂ = (α̂, λ̂) of θ = (α, λ) is obtained by solving this nonlinear system of
equations. It is usually more convenient to use nonlinear optimization algorithms
such as the quasi-Newton algorithm to numerically maximize the sample likelihood
function given in (20).

3.3. Method of Least-Square Estimation

posed by Swain, Venkatraman & Wilson (1988) to estimate the parameters of
Beta distributions. In this paper, we apply the same technique for the TR distri-
bution. The least square estimators of the unknown parameters α and λ of TR
distribution can be obtained by minimizing

    Suppose F (X(j) ) denotes the distribution function of the ordered random vari-
ables X(1) < X(2) < · · · < X(n) , where {X1 , X2 , · · · , Xn } is a random sample of
size n from a distribution function F (·). Therefore, in this case, the least square
estimators of α and λ, say α̂LSE and λ̂LSE respectively, can be obtained by mini-
mizing

    The weighted least square estimators of the unknown parameters can be ob-
tained by minimizing

Therefore, in this case, the weighted least square estimators of α and λ, say α̂W LSE

3.4. Method of Percentile Estimation
   If the data comes from a distribution function which has a closed form, then we
can estimate the unknown parameters by fitting a straight line to the theoretical
points obtained from the distribution function and the sample percentile points.
This method was originally suggested by Kao (1958, 1959) and it has been used for
Weibull distribution and for generalized exponential distribution. In this paper,
we apply the same technique for the TR distribution. Since,

3.5. Method of L-Moments Estimation
    In this section, we provide the L-moments estimators, which can be obtained
as the linear combinations of order statistics. The L-moments estimators were
originally proposed by Hosking (1990), and it is observed that the L-moments
estimators are more robust than the usual moment estimators. The L-moment es-
timators are also obtained in the same way as the ordinary moment estimators, i.e.
by equating the sample L-moments with the population L-moments. L-moment
estimation provides an alternative method of estimation that is analogous to con-
ventional moments. It has the advantage that it exists whenever the mean of the
distribution exists, even though some higher moments may not exist, and it is rel-
atively robust to the effects of outliers (Hosking 1994). Hosking (1990) states that
the L-moment estimators are reasonably efficient when compared to the maximum
likelihood estimators for distributions such as the normal distribution, the Gumbel
distribution, and the GEV distribution.

   In this case, the L-moments estimators can be obtained by equating the first
two sample L-moments with the corresponding population L-moments. The first
two sample L-moments are

3.6. Method of Maximum Product of Spacings
   Cheng & Amin (1979, 1983) introduced the maximum product of spacings
(MPS) method as an alternative to MLE for the estimation of parameters of
continuous univariate distributions. Ranneby (1984) independently developed the
same method as an approximation for the Kullback-Leibler measure of information.
   Using the same notations in subsection 3.4, the uniform spacings of a random
sample from the TR distribution are defined as:

         Di (α, λ) = F (xi:n | α, λ) − F (xi−1:n | α, λ) ,       i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
                                                                  Pn+1
where F (x0:n | α, λ) = 0 and F (xn+1:n | α, λ) = 1. Clearly          i=1 Di (α, λ) = 1.

α           bM P S , of the parameters α, and λ, are obtained by maximizing, with
respect to α and λ, the geometric mean of the spacings:

                                              i=1
or, equivalently, by maximizing the function
                                               n+1

   The estimators α            bM P S of the parameters α and λ can be obtained
                    bM P S and λ
by solving the nonlinear equations

    Cheng & Amin (1983) showed that maximizing H as a method of parameter
estimation is as efficient as MLE estimation and the MPS estimators are consistent
under more general conditions than the MLE estimators.

3.6.1. Method of Cramér-Von-Mises

    To motivate our choice of Cramér-von-Mises type minimum distance estima-
tors, (Macdonald 1971) provided empirical evidence that the bias of the estimator
is smaller than the other minimum distance estimators. Thus, The Cramér-von-
                     bCM E and λ
Mises estimates that α          bCM E of the parameters α and λ are obtained by
minimizing, with respect to α and λ, the function:
                                  n                           2

These estimators can also be obtained by solving the non-linear equations:

3.6.2. Methods of Anderson-Darling and Right-tail Anderson-Darling

    The Anderson-Darling test was developed in 1952 by Anderson & Darling
(1952) as an alternative to other statistical tests for detecting sample distribu-
tions departure from normality. Specifically, the AD test converges very quickly
towards the asymptote (Anderson & Darling 1954, Pettitt 1976, Stephens 2013).
    The Anderson-Darling estimators αbADE and λ  bADE of the parameters α and λ
are obtained by minimizing, with respect to α and λ, the function:
                      n
                   1X            
 A(α, λ) = −n −          (2i − 1) log F (xi:n | α, λ) + log F (xn+1−i:n | α, λ) . (35)
                   n i=1

These estimators can also be obtained by solving the non-linear equations:

    The Right-tail Anderson-Darling estimates α   bRT ADE and λ bRT ADE of the pa-
rameters α and λ are obtained by minimizing, with respect to α and λ, the func-
tion:

4. Simulation
    We conduct Monte Carlo simulation studies to compare the performance of
the estimators discussed in the previous sections. We evaluate the performance of
the estimators based on bias, root mean squared error, the average absolute differ-
ence between the theoretical and empirical estimate of the distribution functions,
and the maximum absolute difference between the theoretical and empirical dis-
tribution functions. Methods are compared for sample sizes n = 20, 50, 100, and

200. 10,000 independent samples of size n are first generated from the transmuted
Rayleigh (TR) distribution with parameters α = 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10 and λ = 0.7. We
observed that 10,000 repetitions were sufficiently large provide have stable results.
For all the methods considered in this study, we first estimated the parameters
using the method of maximum likelihood. For all other methods, the maximum
likelihood estimates were used as the initial values. Also, the same randomly gen-
erated samples were used to compare all the estimation methods. The results of
the simulation studies are reported in Tables 1-5.
    The pseudo-random numbers were generated from the Transmuted Rayleigh
distribution using the following function:
                   "                          p                          !# 21

    For each estimate we calculate the bias, root mean-squared error, and the av-
erage absolute difference between the theoretical and empirical estimate of the
distribution functions, and the maximum absolute difference between the theo-
retical and empirical distribution functions. The statistics are obtained using the
following formulae.

    Simulated bias, RMSE, and P   Dabs , Dmax for the estimates are presented in
Tables 1-5. The row indicating      Ranks shows the partial sum of the ranks. A
superscript indicates the rank of each of the estimators among all the estimators
for that metric. For example, Table 1 shows the bias of MLE(α̂) as 0.29510 for
n = 20. This indicates, that the bias of α̂, obtained using the method of maximum
likelihood ranks was 10th among all other estimators. Table 6 shows the partial
and overall rank of the estimators; it is used to find the overall performance of
estimation techniques.

Estimation of Transmuted Rayleigh distribution                                     187

   The following observations can be drawn from the Tables 1-5.

  1. All the estimators show the property of consistency, i.e. the RMSE decreases
     as the sample size increases.

  2. The bias of α̂ decreases with an increasing n for all the method of estimations.
  3. The bias of λ̂ decreases with an increasing n for all the method of estimations.
  4. The bias of α̂ generally increases with an increasing alpha for any given alpha
     and n and for all methods of estimation.

  5. In terms of RMSE, all the methods of estimation produce smaller RMSE for
     α̂ compared to that of λ̂.
  6. Dabs is smaller than Dmax for all the estimation techniques. Again, these
     statistics get smaller with a a sample size increase.
  7. In terms of performance of the methods of estimation, we found that max-
     imum product spacing (MPS)estimators is the best method as it produces
     the least estimate biases with the least RMSE for most of the configurations
     considered in our studies. The next best method is the percentile estimators
     (PCE), followed by right tailed Anderson-Darling estimators. The weighted
     lest squared estimation (WLS) method ranked 4th while MLE ranked 5th.
     Method of Cramér-von-Mises ranked 10th among the ten method of estima-
     tion.
  8. While MPS uniformly performed the best for all values of n and α, the PCE
     and WLS method performed the best for α ≤ 5. Their performance was
     degraded for α = 10.

   The overall positions of the estimators are presented in Table 6, from which
we can confirm the superiority of MPS and PCE.

5. Real Data Analysis
     In the following section, for illustrative purposes we present two applications
for the proposed TR distribution to real data for illustrative purposes. These ap-
plications will show the flexibility of the TR distribution in modeling positive data.
For the purpose of comparison, we also fit one Rayleigh parameter, Weibull, and
Gamma distributions for the same data. We use the fitdistrplus R package to
fit the distributions. The fits of these four distributions are presented in the sub-
sequent sections. We present a comparative density plot, plots of the distribution
functions, and Q-Q and P-P plots for all four distributions. For example, Figure 7
shows the comparative density, distribution, q-q, and p-p plots for the guinea pig
data which we discussed in Section 5.1.
    Classical goodness of fit of a given distribution can be assessed via the density
plot and the CDF plot. The Q-Q an P-P plots may provide additional information
in some cases. In particular, the Q-Q plot may provide information about the
lack-of-fit at the tails of the distribution, whereas the P-P plot emphasizes the

lack-of-fit at the center of the Muller and Dutang distribution (Delignette-Muller
& Dutang 2014).
    To evaluate the performance of the candidate distributions that best fit the
data, we calculate the log-likelihood of the fitted models based on numerically ob-
tained maximum likelihood estimations via the fitdist() function, available in
the fitdistrplus R package. We then obtain the values of AIC and BIC. Addi-
tionally, we test for goodness of fit for the candidate models using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov (K-S) test, Anderson-Darling’s (AD) test, and the Cramér-von-Mises
(CVM) test. Note that, the K-S test requires unique items for us to obtain exact
p-values. Therefore, we made sure to break the ties by adding a tiny random noise,
which is uniform between 0.001 and 0.01, to each duplicate observation. Adding
this small noise did not affect the statistical properties of the data. The two data
sets considered in this study include tied observations. As such, we removed ties
for both data sets using the process outlined above. We present a descriptive sum-
mary of original data as well as for the data after ties were broken. This shows
a minor difference between the original and modified data sets. It should also be
mentioned that removal of duplicate observations is necessary for the MPS method
of estimation.


5.1. Example 1: Guinea Pig Data
    Our first data set contains survival times (in days) of guinea pigs injected with
different doses of tubercle bacilli and is given in Table 7. The data has been
analyzed by Kundu & Howlader (2010) and by Singh, Singh & Sharma (2013).
We present the data after breaking the ties.

5.1.1. Finding a suitable distribution for guinea pig data

    We compare the fit of Rayleigh, Weibull, Gamma, and Transmuted Rayleigh
distribution for the guinea pig data set. The data contains tied observations,
and, therefore, we modified the data as discussed above to remove the ties. The
summary of original data set, as well as the modified one, is presented in Table 8.
We do not observe any noticeable difference in the calculated statistics for the
modified data set compared to the original one.

     Next, we present the fit statistics for four distributions for the guinea pig data.
The log-likelihood statistic, the AIC, the BIC, and the tests statistics along with
the p-values for K-S, AD, and CVM goodness of fit tests are presented in Table 9.
Results show that the transmuted Rayleigh distribution best fits the guinea pig
data having the largest log-likelihood, smallest AIC, and smallest BIC among all
four candidate distributions. Graphical check for the model fitting is shown in
Figure 7. From the histogram and theoretical density plots, transmuted Rayleigh
distribution shows reasonably good fit especially in the right tail area. Fitting
right tail area is particularly important for many life testing reliability problems.
From the Q-Q plot, we find that the TR model is reasonably a good fit at the
lower tail of the distribution as well. However, Weibull and gamma seems to be
fitting the data in the middle of the distribution. We made our decision of finding
the best fitting model based on the largest log-likelihood value and smallest AIC
and BIC values. Based on these criteria, TR fits the guinea pig data best.

5.1.2. Bootstrap Estimates (Guinea Pig Data): Bias and Standard
       Errors

    Since the transmuted Rayleigh distribution best fits the data, we carry out ordi-
nary nonparametric bootstrap resampling to obtain bias, standard error, and 95%
bootstrap percentile confidence intervals for the parameters α and λ of the trans-
muted Rayleigh distribution. In ordinary nonparametric resampling, repeated
samples are drawn from the original data with replacements. In addition, to the
original data set, we draw 999 bootstrap samples to obtain the estimators bias
and standard error of the estimators. Results are shown in Table 10. We note
that moments based methods have estimates for α that are around 53 while the
estimates for λ are around 0.58. For α̂, WLS produces the least biased estimate
while MPS a has higher bias. For λ̂, all the methods produce a small bias and
standard error.

5.2. Example 2: Fibre Strength Data

    The second data set consists of 100 measurements on breaking stress of carbon
fibres (in Gba). The data in Table 11 is taken from Cordeiro, Ortega & Popović
(2014). The data was also used in Nadarajah, Cordeiro & Ortega (2013). We
present the data after the ties broker.

5.2.1. Finding a suitable distribution for fibre data

    Similar to the guinea pig data, we compare the fits of Rayleigh, Weibull,
Gamma, and transmuted Rayleigh distribution for the fibres data set. There were
20 tied observations in the data set. We prepared the data by breaking the ties
following the procedure discussed earlier. The summary of the original and the
modified data (after breaking ties) is shown in Table 12. We notice that the mod-
ified data has nearly the same descriptive characteristics as those in the original
data set.

             Table 12: Summary of Fibres data: Original vs Modified.
             Data             Min        Q1      Median    Mean       Q3          Max
             Original        0.390   1.840       2.700     2.621     3.220    5.560
             Ties broken     0.390   1.847       2.700     2.622     3.221    5.560



   For the fibres data, we present fit statistics of Rayleigh, Weibull, Gamma,
and transmuted Rayleigh distribution in Table 13. these show that the trans-
muted Rayleigh distribution best fits the data ans has the largest log−likelihood
(−105.39), the smallest AIC (214.77), and the smallest BIC (219.99) among all
four candidate distributions. A histogram with theoretical density curves super-
imposed over the data is shown in panel (a) of Figure 8. The cdf, Q-Q, and P-P
plots also show evidence that the TR is a good candidate model.

5.2.2. Bootstrap Estimates (fibres data): Bias and Standard Errors

    Since transmuted Rayleigh distribution best fits the fibres data, were obtain
bootstrap biases and standard errors of the estimates of the parameters of the TR
distribution using different methods of estimation. Results are shown in Table 14.
We find that the MLE and all the moment-based methods are nearly unbiased for
the parameter α. The worst performing method for this data set is the MPS, which
produces a relatively large bias (0.325) for the estimate. The bootstrap percentile
confidence intervals for λ shows that the lower limit is actually at the lower bound
for the parameter. Also, note that the moment-based methods produce confidence
intervals for λ, the lower limit of which falls outside the bound of the parameter,
which is −1.

6. Conclusion

     In this article, we have provide explicit expressions for the quantiles, moments,
moment generating function, conditional moments, hazard rates, mean residual
lifetime, mean past lifetime, mean deviation about mean and median, the stochas-
tic ordering, various entropies, stress-strength parameter, and order statistics. The
model parameters are estimated by ten methods of estimation, namely, maximum
likelihood, moments, L-moments, percentile, least squares, weighted least squares,
maximum product of spacing, Cramer-von Mises, Anderson-Darling, and right
tailed Anderson-Darling. We have performed an extensive simulation study to
compare these methods. We have compared estimators with respect to bias, root
mean-squared error, the average absolute difference between the theoretical and
empirical estimate of the distribution functions, and the maximum absolute dif-
ference between the theoretical and empirical distribution functions. We have also
compared estimators wing two real data applications.
    The simulation results show that maximum product spacing (MPS) estimators
is the best performing estimator in terms of biases and RMSE. The next best
performing estimator is the percentile estimator (PCE), followed by the right tailed
Anderson-Darling estimators. The real data applications show that the maximum
product of spacing estimator gives the shortest confidence intervals for the alpha
for Guinea Pig data set and the LSE for Fibre strength data set. Hence, we
can argue that the percentile estimators, least squares estimators, right tailed
Anderson-Darling estimators and the maximum product spacing estimators are
among the best performing estimators for TR distribution.
