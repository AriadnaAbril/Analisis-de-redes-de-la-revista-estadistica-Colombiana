Abstract
It is well-known that some discrete distributions belong to the power series distribution (PSD) family, so it seems useful to study conditions to establish the discrete likelihood ratio order for this family. In this paper, conditions to some cases of PSD family under which the discrete likelihood ratio order we have looked at the holds. Also, we study the discrete version of the proportional likelihood ratio as an extension of the likelihood ratio order. Then we compare some members of the PSD family by discrete proportional likelihood ratio order.
Key words: Binomial distribution, Geometric distribution, Logarithmic series distribution, Negative binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, Proportional likelihood ratio order.
Resumen
Es bien conocido en la literatura que algunas distribuciones discretas pertenecen a la familia de distribuciones de series de potencias (PSD, power series distributions por sus siglas en inglés). Por lo tanto, es útil estudiar algunas condiciones para establecer el orden de la razón de verosimilitud para esta familia. En este artículo, se estudian las condiciones para algunos casos de la familia PSD bajo las cuales se mantiene el orden de la razón de verosimilitud. Otros autores han introducido y estudiado el orden de la razón de verosimilitud proporcional como una extensión del orden de razón de verosimilitud para variables aleatorias continuas. Aquí, se presenta el orden de razón de verosimilitud proporcional para variables aleatorias discretas y se estudian para la familia PSD.
Palabras clave: distribución binomial, distribución binomial negativa, distribución de series logarítmicas, distribución geométrica, distribución Poisson, orden de la razón de verosimilitud proporcional.


1. Introduction
   Recently, many papers have been devoted to compare random variables ac-
cording to stochastic orderings in particular likelihood ratio order. Most of the
contributions are for the continuous random variables. We refer to Shanthiku-
mar & Yao (1986), Lillo, Nanda & Shaked (2001), Hu, Nanda, Xie & Zhu (2003),
Shaked & Shanthikumar (2007), Misra, Gupta & Dhariyal (2008), Blazej (2008),
Navarro (2008) and Bartoszewicz (2009) for more details.
    Ramos-Romero & Sordo-Diaz (2001) introduced a new stochastic order between
two continuous and non-negative random variables and called it proportional like-
lihood ratio (PLR) order, which is closely related to the usual likelihood ratio
order. Belzunce, Ruiz & Ruiz (2002), extended hazard rate and reversed hazard
rate orders to proportional state in the same manner and called them proportional
(reversed) hazard rate orders. So, they studied their properties, preservations and
relations with other orders. In general, the proportional versions are stronger or-
derings and easy to verify in many situations, so they are helpful to check what
components are more reliable, and consequently systems formed from them.
   In the next section, we recall the discrete likelihood ratio order and then com-
pare some members of PSD family. Then we present discrete proportional likeli-
hood ratio order and study it for PSD family at the last section of this paper.


2. Discrete Likelihood Ratio Order for Power Series
   Distribution Family
    We obtain the conditions under which the discrete likelihood ratio order is
established for some cases of the power series distribution family.
Definition 1. Let X and Y be discrete non-negative random variables with prob-
ability functions PX (x) and PY (x) respectively. X is said to be smaller than Y in
the discrete likelihood ratio order (denoted by X ≤lr Y ), if
                        PY (x)
                               is increasing in x ∈ N.                              (1)
                        PX (x)

   Noack (1950) defined a random variable X taking non-negative integer values
with probabilities
                                ax θx
                 P (X = x) =          , ax ≥ 0, x = 0, 1, 2, . . .                  (2)

Discrete Likelihood Ratio Order for Power Series Distribution                         37

He called the discrete probability distribution given by (2) a power series distribu-
tion and derived some of its properties relating its moments, cumulants, etc. Patil
(1961, 1962) studied the generalized power series distribution (GPSD) family with
probability function like (2), whose support is any non-empty and enumerable set
of non-negative integers.
  Note that the Poisson, negative binomial and geometric distributions belong to
PSD family and binomial and logarithmic distributions are in the GPSD family.
                                                                x 1           α θx
   Suppose that X and Y have probability functions P (X = x) = b(θ 1)
                                                                      and
              β θx
P (Y = x) = b(θ x 2
                 2)
                                                                       Y (x)
                    respectively. So, using Definition 1, X ≤lr Y if PPX       PY (x+1)
                                                                         (x) ≤ PX (x+1)
for all x, or equivalently
                                  αx+1     βx    θ2
                              (        )(      )≤ .                                  (3)
                                   αx     βx+1   θ1
Now, we check equation (3) for some members of the PSD family:
                                                   1
   Poisson Distribution: In equation (2), ax = x!    and b(λ) = eλ , leads to the
Poisson distribution with parameter λ. Also, we get
                                   PX (x + 1)    λ
                                              =     .
                                    PX (x)      1+x
Now, if X and Y possess Poisson distribution with parameters λ1 and λ2 respec-
tively, then, using (3), X ≤lr Y if and only if λ1 ≤ λ2 .
    Binomial Distribution: Suppose that X has binomial distribution with pa-
rameters n1 and p1 and Y has binomial distribution with parameters n2 and p2 ,
for all n1 < n2 . Using (3) and after simplification,
                                        
                n1 − x       p1       1 − p2
                                               ≤ 1, x = 0, 1, . . . , n1 − 1
                n2 − x     1 − p1       p2
the left side of the above inequality gets its maximum at x = 0, so, if n1 < n2 and
n1 p1    n2 p2
1−p1 ≤ 1−p2 then X ≤lr Y .
    Negative Binomial Distribution: Suppose that X has negative binomial
distribution with parameters r1 and p1 and Y has negative binomial distribution
with parameters r2 and p2 . Using (3)
                                      
                        r1 + x    1 − p1
                                           ≤ 1, x = 0, 1, . . .
                        r2 + x    1 − p2
                      +x
if r2 ≤ r1 then, rr21 +x ≤ 1 is decreasing in x ∈ N , so gets maximum at x = 0.
Therefore, r2 ≤ r1 and r1 (1 − p1 ) ≤ r2 (1 − p2 ) imply that X ≤lr Y .
    Geometric Distribution: If X and Y are random variables of geometric
distribution with parameters p1 and p2 respectively, then p2 ≤ p1 implies that
X ≤lr Y (it is evident that the geometric distribution is obtained from the negative
binomial distribution where r = 1).
   Logarithmic Series Distribution: For random variables X and Y with
logarithmic series distribution with parameters θ1 and θ2 respectively, if θ1 ≤ θ2
then X ≤lr Y .

    Binomial Distribution versus Poisson Distribution: If X is binomial
distribution with parameters n and p and Y is Poisson distribution with parameter
λ, then X ≤lr Y if
                                            
                              p         n−x
                                                   ≤ 1, x = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n
                             1−p         λ

Also, maximum of the left side expression of the above inequality are given at
x = 0, so, if np ≤ λ(1 − p) then X ≤lr Y .
    Poisson Distribution versus Negative Binomial distribution: Consider
random variable X having Poisson distribution with parameter λ and Y having
                                                               1
negative binomial distribution with parameters r and p. Since r+x is decreasing
in x, then λ ≤ r(1 − p) leads to X ≤lr Y .
    Poisson Distribution versus Geometric distribution: If X is Poisson
distribution with parameter λ and Y is geometric distribution with parameter p,
then, X ≤lr Y ⇐⇒ λ ≤ 1 − p.
   Poisson Distribution versus Logarithmic Series Distribution: Let X
and Y be random variables of Poisson and logarithmic series distributions with
parameters θ1 and θ2 respectively. So, X ≤lr Y ⇐⇒ θ1 ≤ θ2 .
    Negative Binomial versus Logarithmic Series Distribution: The ran-
dom variable X of negative binomial with parameters r and p is smaller in sense
of likelihood ratio order than Y of logarithmic series distribution with parameter
θ in the likelihood ratio order if θ ≥ (1 − p)(r + 1).

3. Discrete Proportional Likelihood Ratio Order for
   Power Series Distribution Family
    Ramos-Romero & Sordo-Diaz (2001) studied proportional likelihood ratio or-
der as extension of the likelihood ratio order for non-negative absolutely continuous
random variables. They obtained various properties and applications of the pro-
portional likelihood ratio order. In this section, discrete proportional likelihood
ratio order is studied. Also, we looked the conditions under which this ordering is
hold for PSD.

Definition 2. For two discrete non-negative random variables X and Y with
probability functions PX (x) and PY (x) respectively, if

                        PY ([λx])

where λ ≤ 1 is any positive constant and [·] denote the integer part function. Then,
we say that X is smaller than Y in the discrete proportional likelihood ratio order
(denoted by X ≤plr Y ).
Definition 3. We say that the discrete non-negative random variables X has
increasing likelihood ratio order (denoted by X ∈ IP LR) if pX ([λx])
                                                             pX (x) for 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1

Theorem 1. Let X and Y be two discrete non-negative random variables with
probability functions PX (x) and PY (x) respectively. If X ≤lr Y and Y ∈ IP LR,
then X ≤plr Y .

Proof . Since

                                        =
                               pX (x)     pX (x) pY (x)
the proof is clear.

    Let X and Y be discrete non-negative random variables with probability func-

tions P (X = x) = b(θ 1)
                          and P (Y = x) = b(θ2)
                                                 respectively. So, using Definition
2, X ≤plr Y if and only if

   Geometric Distribution: Let X and Y having geometric distribution with
parameters p1 and p2 respectively, using (5), we have X ≤plr Y if
                                               [λx]−1
                                PY ([λx])  q      p2

                                 PX (x)      q1 p1
is increasing in x. That is
                                [λx]−1        [λx+λ]−1
                               q2      p2  q        p2

                                [λx+λ]−[λx]
that is equivalent to q1 ≤ q2            . If [λx + λ] = [λx], then q1 ≤ 1. If
[λx + λ] = [λx] + 1, then q1 ≤ q2 . So, X ≤plr Y if and only if p1 ≥ p2 .
     Poisson Distribution: Let X having Poisson distribution with parameter θ.
If
                          x! [λx]−x    (x + 1)! [λx+λ]−x−1
                              θ     ≤           θ
                        [λx]!         [λx + λ]!
then,
                               PX ([λx])     x! [λx]−x
                                         =       θ

   At the end of paper and in order to better understand, some distributions of
the PSD family are simulated satisfying in the above conditions.


4. Conclusions
    In this paper, we compare some members of the PSD family due to discrete
likelihood ratio order. Then we presented the discrete version of proportional
likelihood ratio order as an extension of the discrete likelihood ratio order and
studied it for the PSD family.
