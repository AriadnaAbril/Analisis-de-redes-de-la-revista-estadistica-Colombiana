Abstract
In this paper, generalized exponential-type estimator has been proposed for estimating the population variance using mean auxiliary variable in singlephase sampling. Some special cases of the proposed generalized estimator have also been discussed. The expressions for the mean square error and bias of the proposed generalized estimator have been derived. The proposed generalized estimator has been compared theoretically with the usual unbiased estimator, usual ratio and product, exponential-type ratio and product, and generalized exponential-type ratio estimators and the conditions under which the proposed estimators are better than some existing estimators have also been given. An empirical study has also been carried out to demonstrate the eciencies of the proposed estimators.

1. Introduction
    In survey sampling, the utilization of auxiliary information is frequently ac-
knowledged to higher the accuracy of the estimation of population characteristics.
Laplace (1820) utilized the auxiliary information to estimate the total number
of inhabitants in France. Cochran (1940) prescribed the utilization of auxiliary
information as a classical ratio estimator. Recently, Dash Mishra (2011) pre-
scribed the few estimators with the utilization of auxiliary variables. Bahl Tuteja
(1991) proposed the exponential estimator under simple random sampling with-
out replacement for the population mean. Singh Vishwakarma (2007), Singh,
Chauhan, Sawan Smarandache (2011), Noor-ul Amin Hanif (2012),Singh &
Choudhary (2012), Sanaullah, Khan, Ali Singh (2012), Solanki Singh (2013b)
and Sharma, Verma, Sanaullah Singh (2013) suggested exponential estimators
in single and two-phase sampling for population mean.
   Estimating the nite population variance has great signicance in various elds
such as in matters of health, variations in body temperature, pulse beat and blood
pressure are the basic guides to diagnosis where prescribed treatment is designed to
control their variation. Therefore, the problem of estimating population variance
has been earlier taken up by various authors. Gupta Shabbir (2008) suggested
the variance estimation in simple random sampling by using auxiliary variables.
Singh Solanki (2009, 2010) proposed the estimator for population variance by
using auxiliary information in the presences of random non-response. Subramani
& Kumarapandiyan (2012) proposed the variance estimation using quartiles and
their functions of an auxiliary variable. Solanki Singh (2013b) suggested the im-
proved estimation of population mean using population proportion of an auxiliary
character. Singh Solanki (2013) introduced the new procedure for population
variance by using auxiliary variable in simple random sampling. Solanki Singh
(2013a) and Singh Solanki (2013) also developed the improved classes of esti-
mators for population variance. Singh et al. (2011), and Yadav Kadilar (2013)
proposed the exponential estimators for the population variance in single and two-
phase sampling using auxiliary variables.
    In this paper the motivation is to look up some exponential-type estimators
for estimating the population variance using the population mean of an auxiliary
variable. Further, it is proposed a generalized form of exponential-type estimators.
The remaining part of the study is organized as follows: The Section 2 introduced
the notations and some existing estimators of population variance in brief. In
Section 3, the proposed estimator has been introduced, Section 4 is about the
eciency comparison of the proposed estimators with some available estimators,
section 5 and 6 is about numerical comparison and conclusions respectively.


2. Notations and some Existing Estimators

and study variables respectively from a nite population of size N under simple
random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR). Let Sy2 and s2y are variances

may get various exponential ratio-type and product-type estimators as new family
of tEG i.e. G = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. From this family, some examples of exponential
ratio-type estimators may be given as follows: It is noted that, for λ = 1, α = 0
and a = a0 , tEG in (20) is reduced to

3.1. The Bias and Mean Square Error of Proposed Estimator

   In order to obtain the bias and MSE, (20) may be expressed in the form of e's
by using (1), (2) and (3) as

In order to obtain the bias, subtract Sy2 both sides and taking expectation of (28),
after some simplication, we may get the bias as

                                                   2 −1

get the asymptotically optimal estimator as

The values of λ, α and a can be obtained in prior from the previous surveys,
for case in point, see Murthy (1967), Ahmed, Raman Hossain (2000), Singh &
Vishwakarma (2008), Singh Karpe (2010) and Yadav Kadilar (2013).
    In some situations, for the practitioner it is not possible to presume the values
of λ, α and a by employ all the resources, it is worth sensible to replace λ, α and
a in (20) by their consistent estimates as

                        ω̂ = δˆ21 (Cˆx )−1 and λ̂ = (δˆ40 − δˆ21

δˆ21 , and Ĉ respectively are the consistent estimates of δ21 , and Cx .

   As a result, the estimator in (34) may be obtained as
                                            "                 #

                      t̂asym =          exp                                           (36)

   Similarly the MSE (tEG ) in (33) may be given as,
                                            "               #

Thus, the estimator t̂asym , given in (36), is to be used in practice. The bias and
MSE expression for the new family of tEG , can be obtained by putting dierent
values of λ, α and a in (29) and (31) as

5. Numerical Comparison
   In order to examine the performance of the proposed estimator, we have taken
two real populations. The Source, description and parameters for two populations
are given in Table 1 and Table 2

               Table 1: Source and Description of Population 1 2.

    2      Gujarati (2004, pg. 433) average (miles per gallon) top speed(miles per hour)

    The comparison of the proposed estimator has been made with the unbiased
estimator of population variance, the usual ratio estimator due to Isaki (1983),
Singh et al. (2011) exponential ratio and product estimators and Yadav Kadilar
(2013) generalized exponential-type estimator. Table 3 shows the results of Per-
centage Relative Eciency (PRE) for Ratio and Product type estimators. These
estimators are compared with respect to sample variance.

6. Conclusions
    Table 3 shows that the proposed generalized exponential-type estimator (tEG )
is more ecient than the usual unbiased estimator (t0 ), Isaki (1983) ratio esti-
mator, Singh et al. (2011) exponential ratio and product estimators and Yadav
& Kadilar (2013) generalized exponential-type estimator. Further, it is observed
that the class of exponential-type ratio estimators tE2 , and tE3 , are more ecient
than the usual unbiased estimator and Isaki (1983) ratio estimator. Furthermore,
it is observed that the class of exponential-type product estimators tE4 and tE5 ,
are more ecient than Singh et al. (2011) exponential product estimator.
