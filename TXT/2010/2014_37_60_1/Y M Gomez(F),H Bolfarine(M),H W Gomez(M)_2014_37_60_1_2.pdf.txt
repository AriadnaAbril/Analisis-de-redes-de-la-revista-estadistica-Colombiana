Abstract
The present paper considers an extension of the exponential distribution based on mixtures of positive distributions. We study the main properties of this new distribution, with special emphasis on its moments, moment generator function and some characteristics related to reliability studies. We also discuss parameter estimation considering the maximum likelihood and moments approach. An application reveals that the model proposed can be very useful in fitting real data. A final discussion concludes the paper.

1. Introduction
    In lifetime data analysis it is usually the case that models with monotone
risk functions are preferred as is the case of the gamma distribution. For some
models there are no closed form risk functions (such as the Gamma model) and
numerical integration might be required for its computation. In recent statistical
literature modified extensions of the exponential distributions have been proposed
to contour such difficulties. For example, Gupta & Kundu (1999) and Gupta &
Kundu (2001) introduced an extension of the exponential distribution typically
called the generalized exponential (GE) distribution. Therefore, it is said that the
random variable X follows the GE distribution if its density function is given by

                       g1 (x; α, β) = αβe−αx (1 − e−αx )β−1

where x > 0, α > 0 and β > 0. We use the notation X ∼ GE(α, β) for a random
variable with such distribution.
   More recently, Nadarajah & Haghighi (2011) introduced another extension of
the exponential model, so that a random variable X follows the Nadarajah and
Haghighi’s exponential distribution (N HE) if its density function is given by
                                                              β
                     g2 (x; α, β) = αβ(1 + αx)β−1 e{1−(1+αx) }

where x > 0, α > 0 and β > 0. We use the notation X ∼ N HE(α, β).
   Both distributions have the exponential distribution (E) with scale parameter
α, as a special case when β = 1, that is,

                    g1 (x; α, β = 1) = g2 (x; α, β = 1) = αe−αx

where x > 0, α > 0 with the notation X ∼ E(α). Other extensions of the
exponential model in the survival analysis context are considered in the Marshall
& Olkin’s (2007) book.
    The main object of this paper is to present yet another extension for the expo-
nential distribution that can be used as an alternative to the ones mentioned above.
We discuss some properties for this new distribution like its moments and moment
generating function which can be used for parameter estimation as starting values
for computing maximum likelihood estimators.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 delivers the density and distri-
bution functions, moments, moment generating function, asymmetry and kurtosis
coefficients and hazard function. Section 3 is devoted to parameter estimation
based on maximum likelihood and moments approach. It is recommended that
the moment estimators are used to initialize the maximum likelihood approach.
In Section 4 an application to a real data set is presented and comparisons be-
tween the proposed model and other extensions of the exponential distribution are
reported. The main conclusion is that the new model can perform well in applied
situations.

2. Density and Properties

    A random variable X is distributed according to the extended exponential
distribution (EE) with parameters α and β if its density function is given by


                                                          α2 (1 + βx)e−αx
                                          f (x; α, β) =                                            (1)
                                                                α+β


where x > 0, α > 0 and β ≥ 0. We use the notation X ∼ EE(α, β).

   Figures 1 and 2 depict the behavior of the distribution for some parameter
values.

2.1. Properties
   Let X ∼ EE(α, β), Y ∼ E(α) and Z ∼ Gamma(2, α). Then, the distribution
function for the random variable X is given by

                                   α + β − (β + α + αβx)e−αx
                      FX (x) =                                                         (2)
                                              α+β

     The expectation and variance are given by
                                               α + 2β
                                     E(X) =
                                              α(α + β)

                                       α3 + 5α2 β + 6αβ 2 + 2β 3
                        V ar(X) =
                                      α5 + 3α4 β + 3α3 β 2 + α2 β 3
    The moment generation function can also be obtained in closed form and is
given by

                                          α2 (α + β − t)
                             MX (t) =                                                  (3)
                                         (α + β)(t − α)2

   It also follows that its density can be obtained as a mixture of two positive
ones, namely,
                                    α               β
                 fX (x; α, β) =        fY (x; α) +     fZ (x; α)                       (4)
                                   α+β             α+β

   Using the representation as a mixture of two positive densities, we can provide
a general representation for the distribution moments, namely,
             α             β             rΓ(r)
E(X r ) =       E(Y r ) +     E(Z r ) = r        [α + (1 + r)β] , r = 1, 2, ..., (5)
            α+β           α+β          α (1 + β)

where Γ(·) is the usual gamma function.
                                                                       √
   Using the moments above for the EE model, we can compute asymmetry ( β1 )
and kurtosis (β2 ) coefficients, which are given by
                        p          2(α + 2β)3 − 12β 2 (α + β)
                            β1 =                                                       (6)
                                     (α2 + 4αβ + 2β 2 )3/2


                     3(α + 2β)2 (3α2 + 12αβ + 8β 2 ) − 72β 2 (α + β)2
              β2 =                                                                     (7)
                                   (α2 + 4αβ + 2β 2 )2

                                         √
Lemma 1. Note that as β → 0, then β1 → 2 and β2 → 9 which correspond
to the asymmetry and kurtosis respectively for the √exponential
                                                         √      model. General
coefficients of asymmetry and kurtosis are such that 2 < β1 ≤ 2 and 6 < β2 ≤
9, respectively, as shown in Figures 3 and 4.

3. Inferential Considerations
   In this section, we consider inference for the EE using moments and the max-
imum likelihood approach.


3.1. Method of Moments
     The moment estimators for the parameters α and β are obtained by solving
                                                         α + 2β
                                                                        =   x                             (8)
                                                        α(α + β)
                                                        2α + 6β
                                                                        =   x2
                                                       α2 (α + β)

    From the first equation we obtain the moment estimators for β(β)
                                                                  e as a function
of the moment estimator for α(e α).
                                                    
                            e(1 − α
                            α     ex)           1 2
                       βe =           ,    e∈
                                           α      ,                           (9)
                              ex − 2
                              α                 x x
using (9) and the second equation for the system given in (8) we obtain the moment
estimator for α.
                                       p
                                2x ± 4x2 − 2x2
                            e=
                            α                                                 (10)
                                         x2

   Therefore, α e from (10) replacing α in (9) we obtain β.
                                                         e These estimators will be
used as initial parts to get the maximum likelihood estimation in the next section.

3.2. Maximum Likelihood
    Let x1 , x2 , . . . , xn a random sample from X ∼ EE(α, β), so that we obtain the
log-likelihood function
                                                 n
                                                 X             n
                                                               X
       l(α, β) = 2n log(α) − n log(α + β) − α           xi +         log(1 + βxi )   (11)
                                                  i=1          i=1


   Differentiating the log-likelihood function with respect to α and β, the following
equations follow:
                                               n
                        ∂l         2n     n    X
                              =       −      −    xi = 0                             (12)
                        ∂α         α    α + β i=1
                                            n
                        ∂l             n    X     xi
                              = −         +            =0                            (13)
                        ∂β           α + β i=1 1 + βxi

   From (12) we obtain
                                                           
                             b(1 − α
                             α     bx)                1 2
                        βb =           ,     b∈
                                             α         ,                             (14)
                               bx − 2
                               α                      x x
and the maximum likelihood estimator for α is obtained by resolving numerically
the following equation
                        n
                        X             xi            n
                                                  =                                  (15)
                        i=1
                            1 − (1 − xb  αxi − 1)
                                      α)(b          α
                                                    b

                 b is the solution to the equation (15), and replacing it in (14)
   The estimator α
we obtain β. This algorithm leads to the maximum likelihood estimators for α
          b
and β.

specifies that the model that best fits the data is the one with the smallest AIC

reveals model fitting for the three models, and Figure 7 compares the distribution
functions for the three models with the empirical distribution function.

5. Concluding Remarks
    This paper introduces a new model positive data. It is shown that the model
can be represented as the mixture of two distributions. The scale-exponential
distribution can be seen as a particular case of the new model. It is shown that
the distribution function, hazard function and moment generating function can be
obtained in closed form. Moment estimators are derived and maximum likelihood
estimators can be computed using Newton-Raphson type algorithms. The moment
estimators can be used as starting values for the maximum likelihood estimators.
Asymmetry and kurtosis coefficients are derived and their ranges are plotted. It
is illustrated the fact that the model proposed has more flexibility in terms of
coefficients of asymmetry and kurtosis. A real data application has demonstrated
that the model studied is quite useful for dealing with real data and behaves better
in terms of fitting than other models proposed in the literature such as the GE
and NHE models.
