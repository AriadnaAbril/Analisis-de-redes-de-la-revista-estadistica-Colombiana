Profile Monitoring for Compositional Data. Monitoreo de perfiles para datos composicionales
National University of Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia
Abstract
In a growing number of quality control applications, the quality of a product or process is best characterized and summarized by a functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Profile monitoring is used to understand and to check the stability of this relationship over time. In some applications with compositional data, the relationship can be characterized by a Dirichlet regression model. We evaluate five T 2 control charts for monitoring these profiles in Phase I. A real example from production of concrete is given.
Key words: Control chart, Dirichlet distribution, Statistical process control.
Resumen
En un gran número de aplicaciones la calidad de un producto o proceso está mejor representada por una relación funcional entre una variable de respuesta y una o más variables explicatorias. El monitoreo de perfiles permite entender y chequear la estabilidad de esta relación funcional a través del tiempo. En algunas aplicaciones con datos composicionales, la relación puede ser representada por un modelo de regresión Dirichlet. En este artículo nosotros evaluamos cinco cartas de control T 2 para monitorear estos perfiles en Fase I. Un ejemplo real asociado a la producción de concreto es presentado.

1. Introduction
    In most of the statistical process control (SPC) applications, the quality of
a process or product is represented by the distribution of a univariate or multi-
variate quality characteristic. However, in other applications, process quality is
better characterized by a relationship between a response variable and one or more
explanatory variables. This relationship is usually known as a profile. In these
situations, the focus of the SPC lies on the parameters of the profile monitoring
rather than on the monitoring of the univariate or multivariate characteristics.
Such profiles can be represented using linear or nonlinear models. Some discus-
sion of the general issues involving profile monitoring can be found in Woodall,
Spitzner, Montgomery & Gupta (2004), Woodall (2007), Noorossana, Saghaei &
Amiri (2012) and Qiu (2013). Profile practical applications have been reported
by many researchers, including Stover & Brill (1998), Kang & Albin (2000), Mah-
moud & Woodall (2004), Wang & Tsung (2005) and Kusiak, Zheng & Song (2009).
Several control chart approaches for monitoring simple linear profiles have been
developed by Kang & Albin (2000), Kim, Mahmoud & Woodall (2003), Zou, Zhang
& Wang (2006), Zou, Zhou, Wang & Tsung (2007), Mahmoud, Parker, Woodall &
Hawkins (2007), Soleimani, Narvand & Raissi (2013), Zhang, He, Zhang & Woodall
(2013), Yeh & Zerehsaz (2013) and Amiri, Zou & Doroudyan (2014). Proposals for
monitoring multivariate linear profiles (simple and/or multiple) have been devel-
oped by Mahmoud (2008), Noorossana, Eyvazian & Vaghefi (2010), Noorossana,
Eyvazian, Amiri & Mahmoud (2010), Eyvazian, Noorossana, Saghaei & Amiri
(2011) and Zou, Ning & Tsung (2012).
     The linear regression model is commonly used for monitoring profiles. However,
it is not appropriate for situations where the response is restricted to the interval
(0, 1) since it may yield fitted values in the variable of interest that exceed its lower
and upper bounds. Ferrari & Cribari-Neto (2004) proposed a regression model that
is tailored for situations where the dependent variable Y is measured continuously
on the standard unit interval, i.e. 0 < Y < 1. The proposed model is based on
the assumption that the response is Beta distributed. The Beta distribution is
very flexible for modeling proportions since its density can have quite different
shapes depending on the values of the two parameters that index the distribution.
Vasconcellos & Cribari-Neto (2005) proposed a class of regression models where the
response is Beta distributed and the two parameters that index this distribution are
related to covariates and regression parameters. However, the proposed regression
models are restricted to the univariate case and cannot be applied in many practical
situations where data consist of multivariate positive observations summing to
one, that is, the study of compositional data, see Aitchison (1986) and Aitchison
(2003). Melo, Vasconcellos & Lemonte (2009) proposed a particular structure
for compositional data regression, based on the Dirichlet distribution, which is a
generalization of the Beta distribution for the simplex sample space. A profile
application in a concrete manufacturing plant, which after a preliminary study
was found to fit appropriately this structure motivated this paper.
    Compositional data are frequently encountered in industries such as the chem-
ical, pharmaceutical, textil, plastic, concrete, steel, asphalt, among other. Sev-

eral statistical methods for monitoring processes characterized by compositional
data have been studied. See for example, Sullivan & Woodall (1996), Boyles
(1997), Yang, Cline, Lytton & Little (2004) and Vives-Mestres, Daunis-i Estadella
& Martín-Fernández (2013). However, there are not methods for monitoring these
processes when the random vectors associated to the compositional data present
a functional relationship with a set of explanatory variables.
    In this paper, the control charting mechanisms discussed by Williams, Woodall
& Birch (2007) and Yeh, Huwang & Li (2009) are extended for monitoring func-
tional relationships in Phase I characterized by a Dirichlet regression model using
a regression structure that allows the modeling of relationships between random
vectors with Dirichlet distribution and a set of explanatory variables.
    The structure of this paper is outlined as follows: In Section 2, we show the
Dirichlet regression model for compositional data and the estimation of the model
parameters. Five T 2 control charts approaches used for monitoring linear profiles
in Phase I with compositional data are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the
performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated through simulation studies.
A real example is given in Section 5. In the last section we conclude the paper.


2. Dirichlet Regression
    Compositional data are used to indicate how parts contribute to the whole. In
most cases they are recorded as closed data, i.e. data summing to a constant, such
as 100%. Compositional data occupy a restricted space where variables can vary
only from 0 to 100, or any other given constant. Such a restricted space is known
formally as a simplex, see Pawlowsky-Glahn & Egozcue (2006).
   Let c be a positive number. The p-dimensional closed simplex in Rn and
(p − 1)-dimensional open simplex in Rp−1 are defined by

          Vp−1 (c) =       (y1 , . . . , yp−1 )t : yj > 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ p − 1,         yj < c

where a = (a1 , . . . , ap )t and aj > 0, j = 1 . . . p. We will write Y ∼ Dirichletp (a1 ,
. . . , ap ), see Ng, Tian & Tang (2011).
    When all aj → 0, the distribution becomes noninformative. When p = 2,
the Dirichlet distribution Dirichlet2 (a1 , a2 ) reduces to the Beta(a1 , a2 ) distribu-
tion. The marginal distributions of the componentsPp     of Y, Yj , j = 1, 2, . . . , p, are
distributed as Beta(aj , φ − aj ), where φ = j=1 aj . In this sense, the Dirich-
let distribution can be seen as a multivariate extension of the Beta distribution.
Therefore, we have
                     aj
           E(Yj ) =      ,                                            j = 1, . . . , p    (2)

    The Dirichlet distribution is widely used to model data in the form of pro-
portions, where each observation is a vector of positive numbers summing to one.
It allows great flexibility of modeling, provided by the appropriate choice of its
parameters. See Ng et al. (2011) and Melo et al. (2009).
    Gueorguieva, Rosenheck & Zelterman (2008) described a Dirichlet multivariate
regression method which is useful for modeling data representing components as
a percentage of a total. They described each log(aj ) as a separate linear function
of covariates and regression coefficients. That is, for each component j = 1, . . . , p
they used a log-link with
                                   log aij = β tj Xi                              (5)
for covariates Xi recorded on the ith individual (i = 1, . . . , n) and regression
coefficients β j to be estimated using maximum likelihood. These estimates are
denoted βbj . The estimates a       aij } of aj = {aij } are defined by
                             b j = {b
                                                  t
                                    aij = exp(βbj Xi )
                                    b

Gueorguieva et al. (2008) refer to the {aj } as meta − parameters because they
combine the effects of the covariates Xi using regression parameters {β j }.
    Melo et al. (2009) proposed a generalization of this model. The proposed model
is defined by establishing relationships between the parameters that index the
Dirichlet distribution and linear predictors on the explanatory variables. They as-
sume a set of independent vector observations Y1 , . . . , Yn , where
Yi = (Yi1 , . . . , Yip ) with Yi1 + · · · + Yip = 1, for each i. They suppose that
Yi ∼ Dirichletp (ai1 , . . . , aip ) with

                            aij = gj (β1j xi1 + · · · + βkj xik )                         (6)

where each function gj : R → (0, ∞) is three times differentiable, injective and
known, xi1 , . . . , xik are the values corresponding to the ith observation for k ex-
planatory variables and β1j , . . . , βkj are k unknown parameters corresponding to

the jth component. The model, therefore, has kp unknown parameters, which can
be estimated through maximum likelihood (See Melo et al. 2009).
    The covariates of this regression model affect the vector mean, the variance
covariance structure of the distribution of the observations and the higher-order
moments. The functions gj play a similar role to the link functions of generalized
linear models, in the sense that they specifically define how the parameters of the
distribution of interest are linked to linear combinations of the covariates. The
coefficients of this linear combination are unknown. The regression parameters
are identifiable if the link functions are injective and the covariates are linearly
independent (See Melo et al. 2009).
   In the Dirichlet regression model, if p = 2 we have the Beta regression model
described in Vasconcellos & Cribari-Neto (2005), Gueorguieva et al. (2008) and
Melo et al. (2009).
    The regression coefficients can be estimated using maximum likelihood. Let

likelihood function is given by

3. Profile Monitoring Control Charts
    In this section, we propose and study five Hotelling T 2 control charts for moni-
toring linear profiles with compositional data using the Dirichlet regression model
described in the previous section. The study is limited for Phase I. We consider
the same charts analyzed by Yeh et al. (2009) in their study for profile monitoring
in binary responses: T 2 based on the sample mean vector and covariance ma-
trix (TU2 sual ), T 2 based on the sample average and successive differences estimator
   2
(TSD  ) proposed by Sullivan & Woodall (1996), T 2 based on the sample average
                                 2
and intra−profile pooling (TInt     ) Williams et al. (2007), T 2 based on the Minimum
                        2
Volume Ellipsoid (TM V E ) and T 2 based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant
   2
(TM  CD ) studied by Vargas (2003) and Jensen, Birch & Woodall (2007).
    We assume that when the process is in control, the matrix of model parameters
is B0 . In Phase I control, m independent samples are taken. In each sample r,
r = 1, . . . , m, there are a set of nr independent vector observations Y1r , . . . , Ynr r ,
where Yir = (Yir 1 , . . . , Yir p ) with Yir 1 + · · · + Yir p = 1, for each i = 1, . . . , nr .
We suppose that Yir ∼ Dirichletp (ai1 , . . . , aip ). We assume that the relationship
between the parameters that index the Dirichlet distribution and k explanatory
variables (X1 , . . . , Xk ) given in equation (6) is gj = exp(·).
    For any given sample r, r = 1, 2, . . . , m, B  b r is the maximum likelihood estima-
tor of B. Let β r = vec(Br ) = (β11r , β21r , . . . , βbk1r , βb12r , βb22r , . . . , βbk2r , . . . , βb1pr ,

                        b is a multivariate random vector, where each βbsj represents
                          r                                                              r
the estimator of the parameter corresponding to the explanatory variable Xs ,
s = 1, . . . , k, applied on the j components of Yir .
   The Hotelling’s T 2 statistic measures the Mahalanobis distance of the corre-
sponding vector from the sample mean vector. The general form of the statistic
is
                         Tr2 = (βb − β )t Σ−1 (β
                                               b −β )
                                  r    0    0    r  0

where β 0 is the expected value of βb when the process is in control, and Σ0 is the
                                      r
in-control covariance matrix of β r .
                                b
    In Phase I control, β 0 and Σ0 both need to be estimated and the performance
of the control chart depends on the types of estimates being used. The T 2 statistics
for the proposed control charts are calculated by:

                                            b − β)t S−1 (β

    Although β  b is distributed asymptotically normal we do not know its sampling
                 r
distribution. Therefore, we used simulations to approximate the upper control
limit (UCL). For simplicity we consider that the number of components is p =
2, 3, 4, 5 and 8. For a chart given we generated m independent samples. For each
sample we generated a set of n independent vector observations Y1 , . . . , Yn , where
Yi ∼ Dirichletp (ai1 , ai2 , . . . , aip ), i = 1 . . . , n. The parameters of the Dirichlet
distribution, aij with j = 1, 2, . . . , p, are described by aij = exp(β0j + β1j Xi ) with
β01 = 2, β11 = 3, β02 = 1, β12 = 4, β03 = 3, β13 = −2, β04 = 0, β14 = 2,
β05 = −0.1, β15 = 2.5, β06 = 1, β16 = 2, β07 = 3, β17 = 2, β08 = 1 and β18 = 2.5.
The values of the regressor variable (X) can be random but we have assumed
that X takes fixed values, X = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9. For the m samples generated we
calculate the maximum T 2 , denoted by Tmax           2
                                                           . This process was then repeated
                                                  2
10,000 times which resulted in 10,000 Tmax                values. The 95th quantile of these
  2
Tmax   values was then taken as an estimate of the UCL for that chart.
   For each of the proposed charts, we ran the simulations for m = 30, 60 and
90 samples with a prespecified type I error probability α = 0.05. The UCLs
obtained are shown in Table 1. We used the R language to run the simulations, in
particular we used the DirichletReg-package written by Maier (2011) to calculate
the estimates of β r . We also used the functions cov.mve and cov.mcd from the
MASS-package to calculate βbM V E and SM V E in equation (14), and βbM CD and
SM CD in equation (15).
    If a process is modeled using the multivariate normal regression, the response
variables can take any real value, (Noorossana, Eyvazian, Amiri & Mahmoud
2010). However, this assumption is not met here, because the response variables
for compositional data are always positive and range only from 0 to 100, or any
other constant. Therefore, the use of the multivariate normal regression in this
kind of processes can produce invalid results. For more details see Aitchison (2003)
and Pawlowsky-Glahn & Egozcue (2006).


4. The Performance Evaluation
    In this section we compare the performance of the proposed methods for Phase
I, monitoring of compositional data, through linear regression profiles in terms of
the overall probability of a signal under step and drift shift and outliers. The

signal probability is defined as the probability that at least one sample, of a total
of m samples, is considered to be out of control. When the process is out of
control, a large signal probability indicates better ability of a control chart to
detect the out-of-control process. However, when the process is in control, a large
signal probability actually works against a control chart since it gives a higher
false alarm rate (See Yeh et al. 2009).

    We have that nvec(B                Nkp (0, K(B) ). Following equations (6), (8),
(9) and (10), the information matrix K(B) depends on the unknown parameters of
the regression and of the values assigned to the regressor variable. For simplicity,
we consider that p = 2. So, for β 0 = c(2, 3, 1, 4) and X = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9 we have

β r changes from β 0 to β 1 = β 0 + ∆, with ∆ 6= 0, the process is out-of-control.
The level of shifts in β r is described by the non-centrality parameter (ncp). The
non-centrality parameter measures the severity of a shift to the out-of-control
vector β 1 from the in-control vector β 0 and is defined by ncp = ∆t Σ−1              0 ∆ =

    The out-of-control signal probabilities were calculated based on 5,000 simula-
                                        2
tions, as the percentage of times the Tmax  exceeds the corresponding UCL.
    For step shift or sustained shift, we generate a shift in the vector of parameters
of the regressions, β, from β 0 to β 1 . The shift starts from the sample l, for
l = [m ∗ k] + 1, where [x] denotes the largest integer which is less or equal than
x and k = 14 , 12 and 34 . So, for k = 12 the first half of the samples is in-control,
while the second half is in the out-of-control state. The signal probabilities for
each control chart, when m = 30, were calculated through simulation.

chart are 1 o very near 1, showing an excellent performance to detect step shifts.

three quarters, the second half, and the last quarter of the 30 samples considered.
                          2
With exception of the TInt    control chart, the location of the step shift affects
the performance of the T 2 control charts considered. For example, the signal
probabilities decrease considerably when the shift stars in the half of the samples.

The effect is greater in the TM  V E and TM CD control charts. These charts are
more powerful when the shifts occur at k = 14 and k = 43 .
    For drift shifts, the first sample generated was in control, β 1 = β 0 , and the
process parameter vector started to change from the second sample to β 1 , where

that the TSD , TInt control charts have a good performance for detecting shifts
with trend.
    In the scenario considering the presence of outliers, 5 of them were inserted
randomly in the m samples, with m = 30. They were generated from β 1 , where
β 1 = β 0 +(∆). Figure 7 presents the signal probabilities calculated by simulations.

5. Example of Application
    The concrete is a composite material that essentially consists of a mixture
of cement, water and aggregates, which is regularly used in infrastructure and
buildings construction (Li 2011). The aggregates are rock fragments named coarse
aggregate and sand particles called fine aggregate, which be derived from land- or
sea-based deposits, from gravel pits or hard-rock quarries, from sand dunes or river
courses. The aggregate occupies between 70% and 75% of the concrete volume and
affect its strength, durability, workability and cohesiveness. One aspect of interest
in the quality of the aggregate is the particle size distribution known as gradation
(Alexander & Mindess 2005).
   In order to obtain the gradation of the aggregate, a series of standard sieves
are nested or stacked, one on top of another, with increasing aperture size from
bottom to top, and through which a aggregate sample is passed from top, usually

aided by shaking or vibrating the sieves (Alexander & Mindess 2005, Lyons 2008).
Figure 8 shows a kind of machine used in the gradation process. The sieves labeled
as 200, 100, 50, 30, 16, 8, 4, and P3, have the hole sizes of 0.075 mm, 0.149 mm,
0.297 mm, 0.595 mm, 1.19 mm, 2.38 mm, 4.75 mm and 9.5 mm, respectively.
The gradation results are the percent of aggregate retained on each sieve and the
fineness modulus, which measures the average particle size. This dimensionless
parameter is equal to sum of the percent of aggregate retained on each of sieve
divided by 100. A smaller fineness modulus indicates a finer aggregate and a higher
value represents a courser aggregate.

          sieve at the top.


    In this work, 217 aggregate samples from a concrete manufacturing plant were
studied. The aggregate samples were daily tested during 31 weeks. The set of
daily observations obtained in a week is named weekly sample, therefore, 31 weekly
samples were considered. The proportion passing through of each sieve and the
fineness modulus were measured in each aggregate sample.
    The components j = 1, 2, . . . , 8 are defined by the aggregate size retained
by each sieve. The proportion passing through the sieve j, j = 1, . . . , 8, is the
variable Yj . Each component corresponds to an aggregate with constant size
and the proportion of aggregate passing trough them is identified by the vec-
tor Y = (Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Y8 ). Figure 9 shows plots of the marginal frequencies of each
component for the aggregate samples. We observe that Y4 , Y5 and Y7 are skewed,
which implies that Y does not have a multivariate normal distribution.
    The weekly sample r, r = 1, . . . , 31, contains the daily observations (xir , Yir ),
i = 1, . . . , n, with n = 7. The vectors Y1r , . . . , Ynr are independent and Yir ∼
Dirichlet8 (ai1 , . . . , ai8 ). There is a relationship between the fineness modulus and
the proportion of aggregate passing through each sieve. Figures 10 and Figures
11 show these relationships for the components j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 associated to
the sieves 200, 100, 50, 30, 16, 8, 4, and P3, respectively. A likelihood ratio test
(LRT) for each sample r, shows that the Dirichlet regression models are significant
at the 10%, so the null hypothesis H0 : β11 = β12 = · · · = β18 = 0 is rejected.

   Through simulations we found the upper control limit for each T 2 control chart
proposed in the section (3). The T 2 control chart based on successive differences
suggests that the process does not present step and drift shifts, but the control
chart based on MVE detects the presence of outliers, see Figures 12 and 13.

    Although the engineers believed that the process was in-control, the intra-
profile control chart shows a lot of points outside the upper control limit, see
Figure 15. The usual T 2 control chart detects some of these points, see Figure 16.
Figure 17 describes the behaviour of the linear regressions associated with the first
sieve from the sample. This graph shows that the profile is not stable. The other
sieves have a similar behaviour. As a first result of this application, engineers

6. Conclusions
    In this paper the control charting mechanisms discussed by Williams et al.
(2007) and Yeh et al. (2009) have been extended for monitoring compositional
data profiles in Phase I processes, whose response variable follows a Dirichlet
distribution. This methodology allows us monitoring the linear relationship be-
tween the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution and a set of explanatory variables,
and assess the stability of the parameters that characterize the studied regression
model.

    We used five Hotelling’s type T 2 control charts and compared their performance
for detecting step and drift shifts in the process parameters and outliers in the
studied profiles. Simulation procedures suggest that the T 2 control chart called
intra-profile pooling is an excellent tool in order to detect outliers in the profiles and
step and drift shifts in the parameters of the compositional data profile. The intra-
profile pooling T 2 control chart is based on the average of the sample covariance
matrices of the estimates of the parameters β characterizing the profile. The T 2
control chart based on the vector of successive differences of parameter estimates
is a good alternative for detecting step and drift shifts; while the T 2 control charts
based on robust estimates for the mean and covariance matrix, minimum volume
ellipsoid (MVE) and minimum covariance determinant (MCD) methods, are a
good option for detecting outliers.
   We presented an example of application with real data of the proposed method-
ology, in order to control the quality of the aggregate gradation in the concrete.
The T 2 control chart based on successive differences suggests that the process is in-
control and does not present step and drift shifts, the control chart based on MVE
detects the presence of some outliers, and the intra-profile and usual T 2 control
charts show that the process is out-control. This methodology can be extended to
other processes with compositional data.
    This paper constitutes an initial solution for monitoring compositional data
profiles. It would be worthwhile to study and compare the performance of other
control charts like the change point approach. Since the performance of the T 2
control charts deteriorates when number of parameters increases, it is needed more
research when the number of components in the response variable increase and/or
when the number of covariates increases. Reduction methods for multivariate data
or high dimensional methods need also future research.
    When the process is out-of-control is important to identify the causes of the
anomaly in order to apply appropriate remedial measures. A future work can
implement diagnostic aids such as determining the parameters responsible for out-
of-control signal.
   Finally, some methods for monitoring Dirichlet regression profiles in Phase II
can be developed.
