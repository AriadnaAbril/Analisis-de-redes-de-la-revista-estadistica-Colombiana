Abstract
In this article, we consider the semiparametric regression model and examine influential observations which have undue effects on the estimators for this model. One of the approaches to measure the influence of an individual observation is to delete the observation from the data. The most common measure based on this approach is Cook’s distance. Recently, Daniel Peña introduced a new measure based on this approach. Pena’s measure is able to detect high leverage outliers, which could be undetected by Cook’s distance, in large data sets in linear regression model. The Cook’s distances for parameter vector, unknown smooth function and response variable in semiparametric regression model are expressed by authors as functions of the residuals and leverages. Following the study of them we derive a type of Pena’s measure as functions of the residuals and leverages for the same model. We compare the performance of these measures as to detection of influential observations using real data, artificial data and simulation. The results show that the performance of Pena’s measure is better than Cook’s distance to detect high leverage outliers in large data sets in the semiparametric regression model such as in the linear regression model.

Resumen
En este artículo, se consideran modelos de regresión semiparamétrica y se examinan observaciones influenciales que pueden tener efectos sobre los estimadores para este modelo. Una de las formas de medir la influencia de una observación individual es borrando la observación en el conjunto de datos. La medida más común bajo esta idea es la distancia de Cook. Recientemente, Daniel Peña introdujo una nueva medida basada en estas ideas. Las distancias de Cook para el vector de parámetros, la función de suavizamiento y la variable respuesta en modelos de regresión semiparamétrica han sido expresadas por otros autores como funciones de los residuales y los puntos de apalancamiento. Se deriva en este artículo, una medida del tipo de la de Peña como función de los residuales y puntos de apalancamiento para el mismo modelo. Se compara el desempeño de estas medidas para la detección de observaciones influenciales usando datos reales y bajo simulación. Los resultados muestran que la medida de Peña es mejor que la distancia de Cook para detectar outliers y puntos de apalancamiento en conjuntos de datos grandes en los modelos de regresión semiparamétrica tales como el modelo de regresión lineal.

1. Introduction
    One or few observations could have serious effects on estimators. When an
observation is omitted from the analysis, the fitted equation may change hardly at
all. In this situation, the observation is considered as an influential observation.
Hence, the detection of these observations has received a great deal of attention
in the last decades. Numerous influence measures have been developed to detect
these observations. Firstly, Cook (1977) introduced Cook’s distance, which is
based on deleting the observations one after another and measuring their effects in
linear regression. Following the study of Cook (1977), most of ideas of detecting
influential observations based on the deleting approach have developed. In recent
years, Pena’s measure is one of these ideas.
    The study of influential observations has been extended to other statistical
models using similar ideas such as in linear regression. However, most of the
influence measures are concerned with parametric regression models. In recent
years, the detection of influential observations in the nonparametric regression and
semiparametric regression have been studied (see Thomas 1991, Kim 1996, Kim &
Kim 1998, Kim, Park Kim 2001, Zhu Wei 2001, Kim, Park Kim 2002, Zhang,
Mei Zhang 2007).
    In this article, we consider the influence of individual cases on estimators in the
semiparametric regression model and adjust the Pena’s measure (Pena 2005) for
this model. We compare the Pena’s measure and some types of Cook’s distances
suggested by Kim et al. (2002) as to the success of detection of high leverages
outliers in the semiparametric regression model.
   The study is organized as follows. In Section 2, the semiparametric regression
model is introduced. In Section 3, the formulas of Cook’s distances for semi-
parametric regression model are given. In Section 4, Pena’s measure formula for
semiparametric regression is derived. In Section 5, the success of these measures

to detect influential observations, particularly high leverages outliers in large data,
is analyzed via real data, artificial data and simulation.


2. Semiparametric Regression
   Consider a semiparametric regression model with k explanatory variables
                         yi = zi T β + m(xi ) + εi , (1 ≤ i ≤ n)
where yi ’s are outcomes, zi is a k × 1 vector related to parametric component, xi
is a scalar, β is the k × 1 vector of unknown parameters and m is a smooth un-
known function. There are many approaches to estimate β and m . The Speckman

        e
approach is one of them. Here, we follow the Speckman approach.
                                e
    Let Z = (I − S)Z and y = (I − S)y where S is a smoother matrix. The
local polynomial and the spline estimators are two classes of smoothers in semi-
parametric regression. Here, we use a local polynomial estimator. Hence, the
                                                                              −1
(1 × n) jth row vector of S could be defined as Sxj = tT (XTx Wx Xx ) XTx Wx
where Xx is the n × (p + 1) matrix with its ijth element equal to (xi − x)j−1 ,
Wx = Diag(Kh (xi − x)) is the weight matrix with Kh (.) = K(. |h )/h being a
kernel function and h bandwidth controlling the size of the local neighborhood
                                             p
and tT = tTx (x) = (1, x − x, . . . , (x − x) ) is a vector. Here, it is assumed that K
is a symmetric probability density function. The estimators of β and m suggested
in Speckman (1988) are given by

metric regression model.

    Firstly, we briefly review the derivation of Cook’s distance in the linear regres-
sion model: y = Xβ    β + ε , where y is a response vector, X is a n × k matrix of

known covariates, β is a vector of unknown parameters, and ε is a vector of errors
with mean zero and a common unknown variance σ 2 . yi and xTi denote the ith
row of y and X, respectively, and using the subscript (−i) means that the ith

      b                                                                           b
observation is deleted. Hence, X−i denotes the matrix X withith row deleted.
                                                                            b
Let β = (XT X)−1 XT y be the least squares estimator of β , y = Xβ = Hy where
H = X(XT X)−1 XT is the hat matrix and s2 = eT e/(n − k) is estimation of σ 2 .
      Cook’s distance for measuring the influence of the ith observation is defined

                                 b b                     b b

                        Ci = (β − β −i )T (XT X)(β − β −i )/s2 tr(H)


                            b b
      Using the fact,
                            β − β −i = (XT X)−1 xi ei /(1 − hii )

              b
where hii is the diagonal elements of H and ei is the element of residual vector
e = y − y. The trace of H is defined to be the sum of the elements on the main
diagonal of H. As a projection matrix, H is symmetric and idempotent (H2 = H),
the eigenvalues of a projection matrix are either zero or one and the number of
non zero eigenvalues is equal to the rank of the matrix. In this case, rank(H) =

rank(X) = k and hence, trace(H) = k which means that tr(H) = i=1 hii = k .

4. Pena’s Measure
    Pena (2005) introduced a new measure to determine the influence of an ob-
servation based on how this observation is being influenced by the rest of the
data. That is, the predicted change when each observation in the data is deleted
is measured for each observation. In this way, the sensitivity of each observation
to changes in the data is measured. Pena (2005) showed that this type of influ-
ential analysis is able to indicate features in the data, such as clusters of high
leverage outliers. Pena’s measure has some advantages over Cook’s distance. In
a sample without outliers or high leverage observations, all of the cases have the
the same expected sensitivity with respect to the entire sample. This is an ad-
vantage over Cook’s distance which has an expected value that depends heavily

on the leverage of the case. For large sample sizes with many predictors, the dis-
tribution of the Pena’s measure will be approximately normal. This is advantage
over Cook’s distance which has a complicated asymptotical distribution. The sam-
ple contaminated by a group of similar outliers with high leverages, this measure
could discriminate between outliers and good observations while Cook’s distance
fails to detect these observations. In addition, Pena’s measure can be useful for
identifying intermediate-leverage outliers that are not detected by Cook’s distance
(Pena 2005).
      In the regression model, Pena’s measure is defined as

   Pena’s measure can be expressed as a function of the i th residual and leverage

    Pena (2005) stated that Si would be large if it exceeds median (Si )+4.5M AD(Si )
where M AD(Si ) = median{|Si − median(Si )|}/0, 6745. Pena’s measure is very
effective in detection of high leverage outliers that can not be detected by Cook’s
distance in large data sets. Also, it is very simple to compute (Türkan, S. and
Toktamis, Ö. 2012).


4.1. Pena’s Measure for Semiparametric Regression
   In this study, we derived Pena’s measure formula for the semiparametric re-
gression model. The fitted values vector in (3) can be written as

where βb = (X W X ) X W y and t (x ) = (1, (x − x), . . . , (x − x) ). The

5. Application
    In this section, we compare the performance of our adjusted Pena’s measure
with adjusted Cook’s distances in the semiparametric regression model to identify
influential observations via actual data, artificial data and a simulation.


5.1. Actual Data
    We consider actual data related to diabetes. The response variable is the
logarithm of C-peptide concentration (y) at diagnosis and two predictors are age
(x) and base deficit (z) (Kim et al. 2002). The data set contains 41 observations.
There is a linear relationship between the logarithm of C-peptide concentration
and base deficit, however, there is a nonlinear relationship between the logarithm
of C-peptide concentration and age. Hence, the semiparametric regression model,
yi = zTi β + m(xi ) + ε, is used. Following the study of Kim et al. (2002), the local
                                                    P
linear smoother was used and the bandwidth h = 5.6 was selected minimizing
cross-validation (CV) criterion (CV =         {ei /(1 − hii )}2 ). Table 1 shows the
estimates of both parametric and nonparametric components.
   Figure 1 displays index plots of leverages values h̆ii and residuals ĕi .
   As seen from Figure 1(a), observations 20 and 34 are considered as outliers but
these observations are not considered as high leverage from Figure 1(b) that the
values of h̆ii are not close to 1. Hence, it is said that there is no high leverage

                                                                                 Ü           e
outlier in the data.
    Figure 2 displays an index plot of influence measures (C , Ci∗ , C̆i and Si ) for
this data.

1(b), there are no high leverage outliers in the data. Therefore, according to our
adjusted Pena’s measure Si , which is not useful in situations there are the outliers
with low leverage, no observation is considered influential.


5.2. Artificial Data
                                                                        e
   Since we illustrate the performance of adjusted Pena’s measure Si , an artificial
data set with high leverage outliers is generated for semiparametric regression. We
generate the data set using the model in the study of Kim et al. (2002)

                              yi = 0.5zi + (xi − 0.5)2 + εi

   We generate the 500 observations in which the last 50 observations would
be high leverage outliers. For this reason, the first 450 of xi from U (0, 1) and
zi = i/450 where εi is generated from N (0, 0.02). The remaining 50 of xi are
generated from U (5, 10) and zi = i/50 where εi is generated from N (5, 2). We

tion, Si is clearly better than Cook’s distances (Ci , Ci∗ , C̆i ) to detect high leverage

5.3. Simulation Results
    Here, we present a Monte Carlo simulation study that is designed to compare
the performance of adjusted Pena’s measure for semiparametric regression model.
We generate the data sets from the same model in the previous section. We
consider three different sample sizes, n = 50, 100, 250 with two different levels of

 Ü               e
influential observations (i.e, γ = 10%, 20%). The comparison of influence measures
(C , Ci∗ , C̆i and Si ) in semiparametric regression is carried out by the following
steps:

   1. Generation of the data with certain percentage of high leverages (X’s out-
      liers): For this purpose, we generate the first n(1 − γ)% of xi from U (0, 1)


                                       Revista Colombiana de Estadística 36 (2013) 271–284

        and zi = i/(n(1 − γ)%) where εi is generated from N (0, 0.02). The remain-
        ing nγ% of xi are generated from U (5, 10) and zi = i/(nγ%) where εi is
        generated from N (0, 0.02).

     2. Generation of the data with certain percentage of both high leverages (X’s
        outliers) and outliers (Y ’s outliers): For this purpose, we generate the first
        n(1 − γ)% of xi from U (0, 1) and zi = i/(n(1 − γ)%) where εi is generated
        from N (0, 0.02). The remaining nγ% of xi are generated from U (5, 10) and
        zi = i/(nγ%) where εi is generated from N (5, 2).

     3. Generation of the data with certain percentage of both intermediate-leverages
        and outliers (Y ’s outliers): For this purpose, we generate the first n(1−γ)% of
        xi from U (0, 1) and zi = i/(n(1−γ)%) where εi is generated from N (0, 0.02).
        The remaining nγ% of xi are generated from U (1, 3) and zi = i/(nγ%) where
        εi is generated from N (5, 2).

     4. Generation of the data with certain percentage of low outliers: For this pur-
        pose, we generate the first n(1−γ)% of xi from U (0, 1) and zi = i/(n(1−γ)%)
        where εi is generated from N (0, 0.02). The remaining nγ% of xi are gener-
        ated from U (1, 3) and zi = i/(nγ%) where εi is generated from N (1, 0.2).

6. Conclusions
   In this paper, we derived Pena’s measure formula for semiparametric regression.

           e
The numerical examples and simulation study show that the proposed Pena’s
measure Si performs very effectively in the identification of high leverage outliers
and intermediate-leverage outliers in large data sets that are not clearly detected
by adjusted Cook’s distances for semiparametric regression model.
