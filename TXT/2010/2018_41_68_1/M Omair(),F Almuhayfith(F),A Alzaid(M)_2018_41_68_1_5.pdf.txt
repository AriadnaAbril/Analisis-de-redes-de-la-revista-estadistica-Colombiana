1. Introduction

   Let Y1 be a negative binomial random variable with parameters 0 < p1 < 1,
r > 0, and probability mass function (pmf)
                                     
                            y1 + r − 1 r
               fY1 (y1 ) =              p1 (1 − p1 )y1 , y1 = 0, 1, . . . , (1)
                                y1
and let Wi , i = 1, 2, . . . be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-negative,
integer-valued random variables
                              PY1     distributed as Q-distribution, independent of Y1 .
The random sum Y2 = i=0             Wi has a compound negative binomial distribution
(CQNB) with compounding distribution Q, where W0 = 0 with probability 1.
    The univariate compound negative binomial models arise naturally in insurance
and actuarial sciences and were studied by several authors (see Drekic & Willmot
(2005)). Panjer & Willmot (1981) studied compound negative binomial with expo-
nential distribution. Subrahmaniam (1966) derived the Pascal-Poisson distribution
(compound negative binomial with Poisson distributions) as a limiting case of a
more general contagious distribution (see Johnson, Kemp & Kotz (2005)). Sub-
rahmaniam (1978) investigated the parameters estimates for the Pascal-Poisson
distribution by method of moments and maximum likelihood procedures. Jew-
ell & Milidiu (1986) suggested three methods to approximate the evaluation of
the compound Pascal distribution where the compounding distribution is dened
on both negative and positive integers. Ramsay (2009) derived expression for
the cumulative distribution function of compound negative binomial where the
compounding distribution is Pareto distribution. Wang (2011) presented recur-
sion on the pdf of compound beta negative binomial distribution. Willmot & Lin
(1997) constructed upper bound for the tail of the compound negative binomial
distribution. Cai & Garrido (2000) derived two sided-bounds for tails of com-
pound negative binomial distributions. Vellaisamy & Upadhye (2009b) studied
convolutions of compound negative binomial distributions. Gerber (1984), dhaene
(1991), Vellaisamy & Upadhye (2009a) and Upadhye & Vellaisamy (2014) consid-
ered the problem of approximating a compound negative binomial distribution by a
compound Poisson distribution. Hanagal & Dabade (2013) introduced compound
negative binomial frailty model with three baseline distributions.
    Joint modeling of the bivariate random vector (Y1 , Y2 ) has been studied by
several authors. A variety of bivariate models such as Poisson-Bernoulli, Poisson-
Poisson and Poisson-Geometric are discussed by Leiter & Hamdan (1973), Cacoul-
los & Papageorgiou (1980), Papageorgiou (1985) and Papageorgiou (1995). Ca-
coullos & Papageorgiou (1982) introduced and studied a three parameter bivariate
discrete distribution, which they called the negative binomial-Poisson, to analyze
trac accidents. Papageorgiou & Loukas (1988) derived maximum likelihood esti-
mators for the parameters of the bivariate negative binomial-Poisson distribution.
Recently, Alzaid, Almuhayth & Omair (2017) obtained some general forms for
density, cumulative distribution, moments, cumulants and correlation coecient
of (Y1 , Y2 ), when Y1 has a Poisson distribution, and dierent assumptions for the
compounding distribution, namely Poisson, binomial and negative binomial dis-
tributions, denoted by BPPM, BBPM and BNBPM, respectively. Özel (2011b)

A Bivariate Model based on Compound Negative Binomial Distribution                              89

proposed a bivariate compound Poisson distribution and introduced bivariate ver-
sions of the Neyman Type A, Neyman type B, geometric-Poisson and Thomas
distributions. Earthquake data was used to illustrate the application of these dis-
tributions. Özel (2011a) dened a bivariate compound Poisson distribution to
model the occurences of forshock and aftershock sequences in Turkey.
   In this paper, we study the random vector (Y1 , Y2 ) where Y1 ∼ N B(r, p1 ) and
Wi ∼ geo(p2 ). We refer to this distribution as BGNBD, which stands for bivariate
geometric-negative binomial distribution. The BGNBD distribution can be used
as appropriate model for many problems of social, income and physical nature.
For instance, the number of purchased order and the number of total soled items
per day, the total number of insurance claimed and the number of claimants per
unit time, the total number of injury accidents and number of fatalities and the
number of visits and number of drugs prescribed.
   Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the bivariate geometric-negative
binomial distribution is derived and distributional properties are discussed. Pa-
rameter estimators of BGNBD are derived using the methods of moment and
maximum likelihood in Section 3. Applications on real data sets are presented in
Section 4 to illustrate the BGNBD. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section
5.


2. Bivariate Geometric Negative Binomial

    Distribution

Denition 1. A random vector (Y1 , Y2 ) with the stochastic representation (Y1 , Y2 ) =d
       Y
            Wi ) where Y1 is a negative binomial variable given in (1) and the Wi 's
   P     1
(Y1 , i=0
are i.i.d. geometric variables (p2 ), independent of the Y1 , is said to have a bivari-
ate geometric-negative binomial distribution with parameters r,p1 and p2 . This
distribution is denoted by BGNBD(r, p1 , p2 ).
   The random variable Y2 is distributed according to the compound geometric-
negative binomial distribution (CGNB) with parameters r, p1 and p2 , denoted by
CGN B(r, p1 , p2 ).


2.1. General Properties of Compound Geometric-Negative
      Binomial Distribution

   • The probability mass function
      By using conditional argument on Y1 , it is easy to show that the pmf of
      Y2 ∼ CGN B(r, p1 , p2 ) is given by

              fY2 (y2 ) = rp2 q1 pr1 q2y2 2 F1 (y2 + 1, r + 1; 2; p2 q1 ), y2 = 0, 1, . . . ,   (2)

      where 2 F1 is the Gaussian hypergeometric function (see Abramowitz & Ste-
      gun (1972), chapter 15). Recurrence for the pmf in (2) can be derived using


                                           Revista Colombiana de Estadística 41 (2018) 87108

90                             Maha Omair, Fatimah Almuhayth & Abdulhamid Alzaid

       the recurrence relation of the Gaussian hypergoemetric function,

         (c − a)2 F1 (a − 1, b; c; z) + (2a − c − (a − b)z)2 F1 (a, b; c; z)+
                                                             a(z − 1)2 F1 (a + 1, b; c; z) = 0.

       Thus, we have:
                                                        p1
                                       fY2 (0) = [             ]r ,
                                                     1 − p2 q1

                                                    rpr1 p2 q2 q1
                                      fY2 (1) =
                                                  (1 − p2 q1 )r+1
       and, ∀y2 ≥ 2

         fY2 (y2 + 1) =
                q2
                           {(y2 (p2 q1 − 2) − rp2 q1 )fY2 (y2 ) + q2 (y2 − 1)fY2 (y2 − 1)}.
       (y2 + 1)(p2 q1 − 1)
                                                                                          (3)

     • Moments properties
       Using properties of compound distribution, the moment generating function
       (mgf) can be derived as

                                         p1                p1 (1 − q2 et ) r
                      MY2 (t) = [                 ]r = [                   ] ,                (4)
                                    1 − q1 MW (t)        1 − q2 et − p2 q1

       The mean and variance of CGNBD are obtained as follows:
                                               q1           q1 q2
                                  E(Y2 ) = r      E(W ) = r       ,                           (5)
                                               p1           p1 p2

                                  q1             q1              q1 q2 (p1 + q2 )
                  V ar(Y2 ) = r      V ar(W ) + r 2 E 2 (W ) = r                  .           (6)
                                  p1             p1                    p21 p22

       The Skewness of Y2 ∼ CGN B(r, p1 , p2 ) is given by

                         Y2 − r pq11 E(W ) 3   1      q2             q3 0      q1
        Skew(Y2 ) = E(                    ) =      [3r 12 µ01 µ02 +2r 13 µ13 +r µ03 ], (7)
                              σ Y2            σ 32    p1             p1        p1
                                                      Y2


       where µ0i , i = 1, 2, 3 are the rst three moments about zero of W . As r and p1
       and the moments of W are positive, it follows that the compound geometric
       negative binomial distribution is positively skewed.

       Proposition 1. If r = 1 then CGNBD random variable has the representa-
       tion Y2 = IU where I ∼ Bernoulli(p1 ) independent of U ∼ Geo( 1−p
                                                                      p1 p2
                                                                         2 q1
                                                                              ) i.e.
       Y2 has zero inated geometric distribution.

A Bivariate Model based on Compound Negative Binomial Distribution                              91

     Proof . From equation (4), the pgf of Y2 when r = 1 is
                                                                                        p1 p2
                 p1 (1 − q2 t)    p1 (1 − q2 t − p2 q1 ) + p1 p2 q1             1−p2 q1
     GY2 (t) =                  =                                   = p1 +q1       q2        .
               1 − q2 t − p2 q1          1 − q2 t − p2 q1                    1 − 1−p  2 q1
                                                                                           t

     which is a mixture of degenerate distribution at 1 with probability p1 and
           p1 p2
     Geo( 1−p 2 q1
                   ) with probability q1 . Hence, the proof is complete.

     Since the negative binomial distribution can be represented as a compound
     Poisson distribution with logarithmic compounding distribution. Then, the
     compound negative binomial distribution is a compound Poisson distribution
     with a compound logarithmic distribution as the compounding distribution.
     This is stated in the following proposition.

     Proposition 2. The compound negative binomial distribution with parame-
     ters r and p1 , and compounding distribution with pgf GW , can be regarded as
     compound Poisson distribution with mean λ = −r log p1 and compounding
     distribution with pgf of the form

                                              log(1 − q1 GW (t))
                                 GW ∗ (t) =                      .
                                                    log p1

   • Monotonicity Properties.

     Proposition 3. The pmf of Y2 ∼ CGN B(r, p1 , p2 ) is log-concave for r > 1
     and log-convex for r < 1.

     Proof . The relation
                               fY22 (y2 + 1) ≥ fY2 (y2 )fY2 (y2 + 2)

     is equivalent to
                                    2
     2 F1 (y2 + 1, r + 1; 2; p2 q1 ) ≥2 F1 (y2 , r + 1; 2; p2 q1 )2 F1 (y2 + 2, r + 1; 2; p2 q1 ),

     Using the fact that 2 F1 (a, b; c; x) is log-concave in a for 0 < x < 1 , b > c > 0
     and log-convex in a for −∞ < x < 1, c > b > 0 (Theorem 6 and 7 of Karp
     & Sitnik 2010), we get the result.

     Note that the log-concavity is equivalent to strongly unimodal, and it implies
     that the distribution is unimodal and has increasing hazard (failure) rate.

   • Divisibility and Self-decomposability
     Useful theorems from Steutel & van Harn (2004) regarding the representa-
     tion of innitely divisible and self-decomposable for distributions on the set
     of nonnegative integers are quoted here. The results of these theorems en-
     able us to prove the self-decomposability of the compound negative binomial
     distribution.

      Theorem 1 (Theorem 3.2 of Steutel & van Harn (2004), Chapter II, Section
      3). A pgf G is innitely divisible i it is compound Poisson, i.e., if it has
      the form
                                     G(t) = e−λ(1−Q(t))
      with λ > 0 and Q a pgf with Q(0) = 0.

                       (n + 1)pn+1 =             rn−k pk , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
                                           k=0

      where the r's satisfy rn ≥ 0, and necessarily ∞    n=0 n+1 < ∞. Then (pn )0
                                                              rn                  ∞

      is self-decomposable i it is innitely divisible and has a canonical sequence
      rn that is non-increasing.

     • Remark.
      Note that the probability generating function of the compound negative bi-
      nomial distribution is given by
                                              p1
                              G(t) = (                 )r
                                         1 − q1 GW (t)
                                                     p
                                         −r log 1−q G1
                                   =e               1    W (t)

                                                         log(1−q1 GW (t))
                                   = e−r log p1 (1−           log p1      )


                                   = e−r log p1 (1−GW ∗ (t))
                                   = e−λ(1−Q(t)) .


      Therefore by Theorem 1 and Proposition 2, the compound negative binomial
      distribution is innitely divisible.

      Proposition 4. The compound negative binomial distribution has canonical
      sequence representation of the form
                                                 ∞

                                                     i

      Proof . From Proposition 2, the compound negative binomial distribution
      can be regarded as compound Poisson distribution with λ = −r log p1 and
      compounding distribution with pgf of the form
                                                            ∞

A Bivariate Model based on Compound Negative Binomial Distribution                      93

      Since fW
             ∗i
                is the probability mass function of GiW , we get
                                                     ∞
                                               1 X q1i ∗i

                                             log p1 i=1 i W

      It is easily seen that the canonical representation of the compound Poisson
      distribution is given by

                                  rk = λ(k + 1)fW (k + 1).                            (10)

      Substituting λ = −r log p1 and (9) in (10), we get the relation (8).

      Corollary 1. The compound negative binomial distribution is self-decom-
      posable i the canonical sequence in (8) is non-increasing in k .

      Proof . Follows directly from Theorem 2.
      Example 1. In case of compound geometric-negative binomial distribution,
      we have
                                             ∞

                            rk = r(k + 1)              fW  (k + 1)

                                             i=1

                                      1 − q1 p2

      which is non-increasing function. Hence, the compound geometric-negative
      binomial distribution is self-decomposable.

Denition 2. If X1 and X2 are two rv's with pmf's f1 (x) and f2 (x), respectively.
                                                                                  (x)
Then X1 is less than X2 in likelihood ratio order (denoted by X1 ≤lr X2 ) if ff12 (x)
is increasing in x.

Proposition 5. Let {Wi : i = 1, 2, . . .} be sequence of independent geo(p2 ) random
variables, and let Y1 ∼ N B(r, p1 ) and Y1∗ ∼ N B(r∗ , p∗1 ) be two random variables
which are independent of the Wi 's. Then
                                                   ∗
                                  Y1              Y1

                                   i=1            i=1

if and only if r ≥ r∗ and r(1 − p1 ) ≤ r∗ (1 − p∗1 ).

Proof . The result follows from application of Theorem 1.C.11 of Shaked & Shan-
thikumar (2007), and likelihood ordering of negative binomial distribution and
log-concavity of geometric distribution.

                                                                   p2 p2

       where C.V (W ) denotes the coecient of variation of W . It is interesting to
       note that the correlation does not depend on r. This gives more exibilty in
       modeling as one can let the mean and the variance varies without aecting
       the correlation. Also, One can see that the correlation coecient is a de-
       creasing function of p1 and p2 and assumes only positive values. Obviously,
       the correlation is bounded by 0 and 1, where the lower bound is attained if
       p2 = 0 and the upper bound is attained when p2 = 1 which correspond to
       the trivial cases Y2 = 0 and Y1 = Y2 , respectively.

   • Conditional distribution and regression functions

       1. It is obvious that the conditional distribution of Y2 given Y1 is a negative
          binomial random variable with parameters y1 and p1 . Thus
                                                          1 − p2
                                   E(Y2 |Y1 = y1 ) = y1          ,                      (15)
                                                            p2

                                                             p2 . As the coecient
          which is a linear in y1 with regression coecient 1−p 2


          is non-negative we have the conditional mean of Y2 increases with the
          increase in y1 . Also the conditional variance is
                                                            1 − p2
                                  V ar(Y2 |Y1 = y1 ) = y1          ,                    (16)

          which has similar properties as the conditional mean.
       2. The conditional pmf of Y1 given Y2 = y2 has the form
                                                    y1 +r−1 y1 +y2 −1

           θ = p2 q1 , y1 = 0, 1, . . .
           As a direct consequence of (17), we have the pgf of the conditional
           distribution as
                                                    2 F1 (y2 + 1, r + 1; 2; θt)

                                                    2 F1 (y2 + 1, r + 1; 2; θ)

           i.e. the conditional distribution of Y1 given Y2 = y2 is shifted (by 1)
           generalized hypergeometric probability distribution (GHPD) (see Kemp
           1968). The rst and second derivative of the pgf in (18) yield the
           following results:

                                          E(Y1 |Y2 = y2 ) =
                             (r + 1)(y2 + 1)       2 F1 (y2 + 2, r + 2; 3; θ)

     Example 2. Let (Y11 , Y21 ) ∼ BGN BD(r1 , p1 , p2 ) independent of (Y12 , Y22 ) ∼
     BGN BD(r2 , p1 , p2 ). Then according to Proposition 7, we have (Y11 +
     Y12 , Y21 + Y22 ) ∼ BGN BD(r1 + r2 , p1 , p2 ). Hence, the conditional distri-
     bution is given by
           P r(Y11 = y1 , Y21 = y2 |Y11 + Y12 = z1 , Y21 + Y22 = z2 )

     i.e. the conditional distribution is the product of two negative hypergeomet-
     ric distribution, N HG(r1 , z1 , r1 + r2 ) and N HG(y1 , z2 , z1 ).

   • Limiting Distribution.
     Since the negative binomial distribution with parameters r and p1 converges
     to the Poisson distribution with parameter λ = r(p − 1) where r → ∞ and
     p1 → 1. Thus, we have the following proposition.
     Proposition 8. Under the limiting conditions r → ∞ and p1 → 1 such that
     r(1 − p1 ) = λ , the following relation is true
                                                                          u
                               lim lim MY1 ,Y2 (u, v) = eλ(e MW (v)−1) ,
                              r→∞ p1 →1
                 u
     where eλ(e MW (v)−1) is the mgf of bivariate Poisson-geometric distribution.
     Hence, the bivariate geometric-negative binomial distribution converges to
     that of the bivariate geometric-Poisson distribution

   • Monotonicity

     positive of order 2 (T P2 ) if and only if p(x, y) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X , y ∈ Y and

       Proposition 9. If (Y1 , Y2 ) ∼ BGN BD(r, p1 , p2 ), then the function fY ,Y (y1 , y2 )
                                                                                            1   2
       dened in (11) is T P2 .

       Proof . For z1 < z2 , we have
       fY1 ,Y2 (y1 , z1 )                   z2 !(y1 + z1 − 1)!
                          = (1 − p2 )z1 −z2
       fY1 ,Y2 (y1 , z2 )                   z1 !(y1 + z2 − 1)!
                                                                     z2 !
                       = (1 − p2 )z1 −z2                                                            .
                                           z1 !(y1 + z2 − 1) . . . (y1 + z2 − z1 ) . . . (y1 + z1 )
       which is decreasing function in y1 , hence fY1 ,Y2 (y1 , y2 ) dened in (11) is
       T P2 .

       The T P2 is very strong positive dependence between random variables in
       particular it implies association and positive quadrant dependence and hence
       a nonnegative covariance (see for example Barlow & Proschan (1975)).
       Proposition 10.
          i For r < 1 and y2 = 0, the joint pmf of BGNBD given in (11) is log-
            convex in y1 , otherwise it is log-concave.
         ii The joint pmf of BGNBD given in (11) is log-concave in y2 .

       Proof .
          i In order to prove that the joint pmf of BGNBD given in (11) is log-
                                                        f     (y1 +1,y2 )
            concave in y1 , we need to show that Yf1Y,Y,Y   2
                                                               (y1 ,y2 ) is decreasing in y1
                                                           1 2
            for every y2 .
            But
                  fY1 ,Y2 (y1 + 1, y2 )                    y2 + r − 1           ry2
                                        = (1 − p1 )p2 (1 +                +             )
                    fY1 ,Y2 (y1 , y2 )                       y1 + 1         y1 (y1 + 1)
            Thus, the ratio is decreasing in y1 for r ≥ 1. For r < 1, we have two
            cases, the rst is that y2 = 0 then the ratio increasing and the second
            case where y2 > 0 which is clearly decreasing in y1 .
         ii The log-concavity of BGNBD in y2 follows from the fact that the y1 −
            th convolution of geometric distribution with parameter p2 is negative
            binomial distribution with parameters y1 and p2 which is a log-concave.



     • Stochastic Order
       Proposition 11. Let {Wi : i = 1, 2, . . .} and {Wi∗ : i = 1, 2, . . .} be two
       sequences of independent geo(p2 ) and geo(p∗2 ) random variables, respectively,
       such that p2 ≥ p∗2 . Let Y1 ∼ N B(r, p1 ) and Y1∗ ∼ N B(r∗ , p∗1 ) be two random
       variables which are independent of Wi ś and Wi∗ ś, respectively, where r ≥ r∗
                                                                      PY1∗
       and r(1 − p1 ) ≤ r∗ (1 − p∗1 ), then (Y1 , Yi=1 Wi ) ≤st (Y1∗ , i=1 Wi∗ ).
                                                 P 1

       Proof . The result follows from an application of Theorem 6.B.3 of Shaked
       & Shanthikumar (2007) and Proposition 5.

3. Estimation

  Assume that we have n pairs of observations (y1i , y2i ); i = 1, 2, . . . , n from
BGNBD with parameters r,p1 and p2 .

   • Method of moments
     The moment estimates p̂1M M , p̂2M M and r̂M M of p1 ,p2 and r are obtained
     from solving the moments equations. Using the moments
                                                  q1
                                       E(Y1 ) = r    ,
                                                  p1
                                                    q1

                                      E(Y2 ) = r       ,
                                                 p1 p2
     we get
                                                 r̂M M
                                   p̂1M M =                ,
                                             r̂M M + ȳ1
                                                    ȳ1
                                     p̂2M M =            ,
                                               ȳ1 + ȳ2
                                                   ȳ 2
                                      r̂M M = 2 1 .
                                               s1 − ȳ1

     As the value of r is non-negative, then the estimate r̂M M has meaning only
     when s21 > ȳ1 .
   • Maximum Likelihood
     Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the parameters p1 , p2 and r can
     be derived by considering the likelihood function given by
                 n                         
                Y    y1i + r − 1 y1i + y2i − 1 r
           L=                                  p1 (1 − p1 )y1i py21i (1 − p2 )y2i .
                i=1
                         y 1i         y2i


     Then it can be seen that the MLE satisfy
                                                 r̂M LE
                                  p̂1M LE =               ,

4. Numerical Example

   For comparison purposes, the BGNBD was tted to the same sets of accident
data used by Leiter & Hamdan (1973) and Cacoullos & Papageorgiou (1980), i.e.,
the total number of injury accidents recorded during 639 days (in 1969 and 1970)
in a 50-mile stretch of highway in eastern Virginia (Y1 ), and the corresponding
number of fatalities (Y2 ) for individual years. We look at the data as three sets
of data. The rst data is the entire study, the second and third set of data
representing the total number of injury accidents in 1969 and 1970, respectively.
Descriptive statistics of the considered data are presented in Table 1.
   As the estimation criterion holds (s21 > ȳ1 ), hence we considered estimating the
parameters using both methods the moments and the maximum likelihood. The
results are reported in Table 2. Comparing the MM and MLE of the parameters
show that they are quite similar. The estimated variance-covariance matrix of the
maximum likelihood estimators are computed for each data set.

In order to investigate the performance of the BGNBD, we compared the tting of
this model with the results of tting the bivariate Poisson-Poisson (BPPD), bivari-
ate binomial-Poisson (BBPD), bivariate geometric-Poisson (BGPD), and bivariate
negative binomial-Poisson (BNBPD) distributions to the data (For more informa-
tion about these distributions, see Alzaid et al. (2017)). The BBPD is tted assum-
ing dierent values of the parameter m, the BNBPD assuming dierent values of
the parameter r for the rst two data sets, in this case the moments estimates coin-
cide with the maximum likelihood estimates. The t of each model was measured
                                                     P and chi-square goodness-of-
using the Akaike information criterion AIC, SSE values
t criterion, where the SSE is dened by SSE = ally1 ,y2 (observed − expected)2 .
The observed and expected values for the bivariate models along with the log-
likelihood, AIC, χ2 values, degrees of freedom (d.f.), corresponding p-values and
SSE are given in Tables 3-5. Figure 1 demonstrates the tted distributions. The
values of χ2 , were computed after the grouping of bolded cells in the table. The
results show that the log-likelihood and AIC values of all the bivariate models

102                            Maha Omair, Fatimah Almuhayth & Abdulhamid Alzaid

are essentially the same. Note that the t of the models BPPD, BBPD, BGPD
and BNBPD is much better for the individual years, than it is for the entire 639
days. It is obvious from the χ2 and SSE values in Table 3 that the models BPPD,
BBPD, BGPD and BNBPD could not give a satisfactory t for the data. The
t by BGNBD yields a smaller χ2 and SSE values as compared with the other
models, which implies that this model ts the data well, this is also reected by
the p-value. Same conclusion is reached from Table 4. The p-values of the models
in Table 5, suggest acceptable with the superiority of BGNBD as judged by larger
p-value and smaller SSE.

5. Conclusions

    In this paper, the moments, cumulants, skewness of the univariate CGNBD
are derived. Some monotonicity and distributional properties of the univariate
CGNBD are provided. Then, BGNBD is dened and some important probabilis-
tic characteristics such as moments, cumulants, covariance, and the coecient
of correlation are obtained. Some applications to accident data have been pre-
sented to illustrate the usage of the BGNBD. The results showed the superiority
of BGNBD among other competitive models in the presented applications.
