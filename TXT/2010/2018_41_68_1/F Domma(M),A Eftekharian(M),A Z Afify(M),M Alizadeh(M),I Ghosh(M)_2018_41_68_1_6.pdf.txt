A bstract
This paper introduces a new four-parameter lifetime model called the odd log-logistic Dagum distribution. The new model has the advantage of being capable of modeling various shapes of aging and failure criteria. We derive some structural properties of the model odd log-logistic Dagum such as order statistics and incomplete moments. The maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the model parameters. Simulation results to assess the performance of the maximum likelihood estimation are discussed. We prove empirically the importance and exibility of the new model in modeling real data.

1. Introduction

    In 1977, the Professor Camilo Dagum has derived the distribution function,
which is called Dagum distribution, from a set of assumptions characterizing the
observed regularities in the income distributions from both developed and devel-
oping countries (Dagum 1977). Then the Dagum distribution has been extensively
and successfully used in researches on income and wealth. Based on this distri-
bution, many authors have extensively studied the characteristics and properties
of the Dagum model. In addition to, many works published by the same Dagum,
we point out the papers of Kleiber (1996, 1999), Quintano & D'Agostino (2006),
Domma (2007), Pérez & Alaiz (2011), just to name a few. Kleiber & Kotz (2003)
and Kleiber (2008) provided an accurate and in-depth reviews of the genesis of
Dagum distribution and its empirical applications.
    Domma (2002) showed that the hazard rate of the Dagum distribution, ac-
cording to the values of parameters, can be monotonically decreasing, upside-down
bathtub, and, nally, bathtub then upside-down bathtub. This particular exibil-
ity of the hazard rate has led to several authors apply the Dagum distribution in
dierent elds, such as survival analysis and reliability theory (see, for example,
Domma, Giordano & Zenga, 2011, 2012).
    In order to increase the exibility of the Dagum distribution, some authors
have proposed dierent transformations of such distribution. Domma & Condino
(2013) introduced a ve parameter Beta-Dagum distribution, the special case of
four-parameter of Beta Dagum has been used by Domma & Condino (2016) for
modeling hydrologic data. Oluyede & Rajasooriya (2013) proposed the six pa-
prameter Mc-Dagum Distribution. Among the various transformations found in
the literature, we remember the Exponentiated Kumaraswamy Dagum distribution
(Huang & Oluyede 2014), the Weighted Dagum (Oluyede & Ye 2014), the trans-
muted Dagum distribution (Elbatal & Aryal 2015), the Weibull Dagum distribu-
tion (Tahir, Cordeiro, Mansoor, Zubair & Alizadeh 2016), the Dagum Poisson Dis-
tribution (Oluyede, Motsewabagale, Huang, Warahena-Liyanage & Pararai 2016).

The Odd Log-Logistic Dagum Distribution: Properties and Applications                 111

   Recently, Gleaton & Lynch (2006) dened a new transformation of distribution
function called the odd log-logistic-G (OLL-G) family with one additional shape
parameter α > 0 by the cumulative distribution function (cdf)
                                             G(x; ϕ)α
                        F (x; α, ϕ) =                       ,                        (1)
                                        G(x; ϕ)α + G(x; ϕ)α

where G(x; ϕ) = 1 − G(x; ϕ). The corresponding probability density function
(pdf) of (1) is given by

                                  α g(x; ϕ)G(x; ϕ)α−1 G(x; ϕ)α−1
                  f (x; α, ϕ) =                           2    .                   (2)
                                       G(x; ϕ)α + G(x; ϕ)α

In general a random variable X with pdf (2) is denoted by X ∼ OLL-G(α, ϕ).
    An interpretation of the OLL family (1) can be given as follows. Let T be a
random variable describing a stochastic system by the cdf G(x). If the random
variable X represents the odds, the risk that the system following the lifetime T
will be not working at time x is given by G(x)/[1 − G(x)]. If we are interested in
modeling the randomness of the odds by the log-logistic pdf r(t) = α tα−1 /(1+tα )2
(for t > 0), the cdf of X is given by
                                                    
                                              G(x)
                           P r(X ≤ x) = Π               ,
                                            1 − G(x)
                    α
   where Π(t) = 1+t
                 t
                   α is the cdf of log-logistic distribution.

   For generating data from this distribution, if u ∼ u(0, 1) then
                                    (          1
                                                       )
                                 −1          uα
                         Xu = G          1           1
                                       u α + (1 − u) α

has cdf (1).
    The aim of this paper is to dene and study a new lifetime model called the odd
log-logistic Dagum (OLLDa) distribution. Its main feature is that one additional
shape parameter is inserted in (3) to provide greater exibility for the generated
distribution. Based on the odd log-logistic-G (OLL-G) family of distributions, we
construct the four-parameter OLLDa model and give a comprehensive description
of some of its mathematical properties in order that it will attract wider applica-
tions in reliability, engineering and other areas of research. In fact, the OLLDa
model can provide better ts than other competitive models.
    This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we dene the OLLDa dis-
tribution. We derive useful mixture representations for the pdf and cdf and give
some plots for its pdf and hazard rate function (hrf) in Section 3. We provide
in Section 4 some mathematical properties of the OLLDa distribution including
quantile function, ordinary and incomplete moments, moment generating function
(mgf), mean deviations, probability weighted moments (PWMs), moments of the
residual life, reversed residual life and order statistics and their moments are de-
termined. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the unknown parameters

two real data sets to illustrate its potentiality. Finally, in Section 7, we provide a
simulation study.

Quantile function is considered as an important quantity in each distribution and
is used widely for simulation of that distribution and nding key percentiles. One
can obtain the quantile function of OLLDa distribution by inverting (5) as follows
                                     "                 # −1  −1
                                                                b
                                                1          c 
                                             uα
                   QX (u) = a −1 +        1           1           .             (7)
                                       u α + (1 − u) α      

An application of the quantile function is to generate numbers of the distribu-
tion. We can easily simulate the OLLDa random variable based on the quantile
function. If U is a random variable from Uniform distribution on the unit in-
terval, i.e. U ∼ u(0, 1), then the random variable X = QX (U ) follows (6), that
is X ∼OLLDa(α, a, b, c). In addition, one is interested to analyze the variability
of the kurtosis and skewness on the basis of the shape parameters of X . This
purpose can be obtained using quantile function and based on the Moors kurtosis
(Moors 1988) and Bowley skewness (Kenney & Keeping 1962).


2.1. Asymptotics of the OLL-Da Distribution Function,
      Density and Hazard Rate

    The OLL-Da distribution has interesting asymptotic properties based on the
cdf, pdf and hrf. The properties are obtained when either x → 0 or x → ∞. In
what follows, we present two propositions for asymptotic properties of the OLL-Da
distribution.
Proposition 1. The asymptotics of OLL-Da distribution for cdf, pdf and hrf as
x → 0 are given by

3. Plots and Linear Representation

    In this section, we provide some plots of the pdf and hrf of the OLLDa model
to show its exibility. Figure 1 displays some plots of the OLLDa density for some
parameter values a, b, c and α. Plots of the hrf of the OLLDa model for selected
parameter values are given in Figure 2, where the hrf can be bathtub, upside down
bathtub (unimodal), increasing, decreasing or constant.

3.1. Linear Representation

    Many authors paid attention to the mixture representations for the pdf and
cdf of new family distributions, because using the mixture representations one
can easily derive some mathematical properties such as incomplete moments and
moments of residual life. To obtain these mixture representations of the OLLDa
cdf, we need to the following remark.

erties of the OLLDa model can be obtained from (11) and those are properties of
the Dagum distribution.


4. The OLLDa Properties

   We investigate mathematical properties of the OLLDa distribution including
ordinary and incomplete moments, PWMs and order statistics. It is better to
obtain some structural properties of the OLLDa distribution by establishing al-
gebraic expansions than computing those directly by numerical integration of its
density function. To this end, we apply the obtained results in the last section.


4.1. Ordinary and Incomplete Moments

   The nth ordinary moment of X is given by

                                   k=0         0

For n ≤ b, we get
                                  ∞

The nth incomplete moment, say ϕn (t), of the OLLDa distribution is given by

ϕn (t) = 0 xn f (x)dx. Therefore, we can write from equation (11)

rst incomplete moment has important applications related to the Bonferroni and
Lorenz curves and the mean residual life and the mean waiting time. Furthermore,
the amount of scatter in a population is evidently measured to some extent by the
totality of deviations from the mean and median. The mean deviations, about the
mean and about the median of X , depend on ϕ1 (t).


4.2. Residual and Reversed Residual Lifes

    The nth moment of the residual life, denoted by mn (t) = E[(X − t)n | X > t]
for t > 0 and n = 1, 2, . . . , uniquely determines F (x) (see Navarro, Franco &
Ruiz 1998). The nth moment of the residual life of X is given by
                                          Z ∞
                                    1
                    mn (t) =                  (x − t)n dF (x).               (15)
                                 1 − F (t) t

Based on (15) we can write
                           n   ∞
                  1 X X (−1)n−i tn−i
     mn (t) =                        (n)i dk ck ai Bz (1 − i/b, ck + i/b) ,
                 R(t) i=0    i!
                               k=0

where R(t) = 1 − F (t) and (n)i = Γ(n + 1)/Γ(n − i + 1) is the falling factorial.
   Another interesting function is the mean residual life function or the life ex-
pectation at age x dened by m1 (t) = E [(X − t) | X > t], which represents the
expected additional life length for a unit which is alive at age t. The mean resid-
ual life of the OLLDa distribution can be obtained by setting n = 1 in the last
equation.

120Filippo Domma, Abbas Eftekharian, Ahmed Z. Afy, Morad Alizadeh & Indranil Ghosh

   Navarro et al. (1998) proved that the nth moment (for n = 1, 2, . . .) of the
reversed residual life, say Mn (t) = E [(t − X)n | X ≤ t] for t > 0, uniquely deter-
mines F (x). By denition, the nth moment of the reversed residual life is given
by
                                         Z t
                                     1
                           Mn (t) =          (t − x)n dF (x).
                                    F (t) 0
So, it is clear that the nth moment of the reversed residual life of X is as follows
                       n   ∞
                   1 X X (−1)i
       Mn (t) =                (n)i dk ck ai tn−i Bz (1 − i/b, ck + i/b).
                  F (t) i=0 i!
                           k=0

The mean inactivity time or mean waiting time, also called the mean reversed
residual life function, say M1 (t) = E[(t − X) | X ≤ t], represents the waiting time
elapsed since the failure of an item on condition that this failure had occurred in
(0, t). The mean inactivity time of X can be obtained by setting n = 1 in the
above equation.


4.3. Mean deviations and Bonferroni and Lorenz Curves


    The amount of scatter in a population is evidently measured to some extent
by the totality of deviations from the mean and median. If X has the OLLDa
                                             R ∞ about the mean ν = E(X) and
distribution, we can derive the mean deviations
about the median M from the relations δ1 = 0 |x − ν| f (x)dx = 2νF (ν)−2ϕ1 (ν)
           R∞
and δ2 = 0 |x − M | f (x)dx = ν − 2ϕ1 (M ), respectively, where F (ν) is simply
calculated from (5), ϕ1 (ν) is the rst incomplete moment given by
                                ∞
                                X
                     ϕ1 (ν) =         dk ck a Bz (1 − 1/b, ck + 1/b).                  (16)
                                k=0

Bonferroni, B(p), and Lorenz, L(p), curves have applications in economics, to
study income and poverty, reliability, demography, insurance and medicine. They
are dened by B(p) = ϕ1 (q)/pν and L(p) = ϕ1 (q)/ν , respectively, where q =
                                           −1/c −1/b
                                                     . These measures can be cal-
               
Q(p) = a (−1 + p1/α /[p1/α + (1 − p)1/α ]      )
culated immediately from equation (16) evaluated at ν = q .


4.4. Probability Weighted Moments


   The PWMs are used to derive estimators of the parameters and quantiles of
generalized distributions. These moments have low variance and no severe bias,
and they compare favorably with estimators obtained by the maximum likelihood
method. The (s, r)th PWM of X (for r ≥ 1, s ≥ 0) is formally dened by
                                                Z ∞
                   ρr,s = E [X r F (X)s ] =           xr F (x)s f (x)dx.

The last equation can be rewritten as follows
                                         ∞
                                         X
                     f (x)F (x)s =             qk,l g(x; a, b, c [α (s + k + 1) + l]).
                                     k,l=0

Then, we have
                           ∞
                           X             Z ∞
                 ρr,s =           qk,l         xr g(x; a, b, c [α (s + k + 1) + l])dx.
                          k,l=0          0


The above equation reveals that the (s, r)th PWM of X is a linear combination of
the Da densities. So, we can write
               ∞
               X
   ρr,s = ar           qk,l c [α (s + k + 1) + l] B(1 − r/b, c [α (s + k + 1) + l] + r/b).

distribution by Xi:n and fi:n (x), respectively. By suppressing the parameters, we
have (for i = 1, 2, . . . , n)

    It is clear that the density function of the ith order statistic from the OLLD
distribution is a linear combination of the Dagum densities. So, we can easily
obtain the mathematical properties for Xi:n . For example, the rth moment of
Xi:n follows from

5. Estimation

    Several methods to estimate parameters were proposed in the literature, but
the most popular method is maximum likelihood method. Based on this method,
one obtains the maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs) for the parameters. Af-
ter that, using asymptotic property of MLE, it is easy to derive a 100(1 − γ)%
approximate condence interval for each parameter. Here, for simplify, we use
g(x) and G(x) as the pdf and cdf of Dagum distribution and obtain the MLEs of
parameters for OLLDa(α, a, b, c) distribution. To this purpose, let X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn
be a random sample of size n from the OLLDa distribution given by (6). The
log-likelihood function of the vector parameters θ = (α, a, b, c) is as follows

                         n
                         X                                              
  `(θ) = n ln α +              ln g(xi ) + (α − 1) ln G(xi ) + ln Ḡ(xi )
                         i=1
                                                                       − 2 ln G(xi )α + Ḡ(xi )α .
                                                                                               


It can be shown that
             n                                n
          n X                                X   G(xi )α ln G(xi ) + Ḡ(xi )α ln Ḡ(xi )

more details, see Appendix.
   The MLEs can be obtained using the solutions of above equations, but these
equations are nonlinear and one can be solved them iteratively.
    On the other hand, to obtain the 100(1 − γ)% approximate condence interval
for each parameter, we need to the Fisher information matrix and for this purpose,
we should obtain the following expectation

6. Application

    In this section, we show that the OLLDa distribution can be a better model
than the Dagum, Beta Burr XII (BBXII) (Paranaíba, Ortega, Cordeiro & Pescim
2011), Beta Dagum (BDa) Domma & Condino (2013), Mc-Dagum (Mc-Da) Oluyede
& Rajasooriya (2013) and Dagum-Poisson (DaP) Oluyede et al. (2016) distribu-
tions using two real data sets. To this end, we compare various models using
criteria like log likelihood, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Cramer-von Mises
(W ∗ ) and Anderson-Darling (A∗ ) statistics based on the data sets. Cramer-von
Mises (W ∗ ) and Anderson-Darling (A∗ ) statistics are dened as follows Evans,

   If a model has smaller values of -log likelihood, AIC, W ∗ and A∗ , then it is
better than other models.
   The numerical results of MLEs and their corresponding standard errors (in
parentheses) for the parameters of model are reported in Tables 1 and 2 for the
rst and second data sets, respectively. Figure 5(a) and (b) displays the tted
densities for the rst and second data sets obtained using kernel density estimation
based on Gaussian kernel function, respectively. Suppose that X1 , . . . , Xn is a
random sample of independent and identically distributed random variables with
an unknown pdf f . Then the kernel density estimator of f is derived by
                                                  n
                                              1 X x − xi
                                     fˆ(x) =        k(   ),
                                             nh i=1    h

where k(·) is the kernel function and h is a smoothing parameter or bandwidth.
Silverman (1986) is an appropriate reference for more details of kernel estimation
and its properties. In Figure 9, we have considered the standard normal as kernel
function, k(·), with bandwidth h = (4σ̂/3n)1/5 , where σ̂ is the standard deviation
of the interested sample.
    In addition, the plots of the tted distributions for the data sets are exhibited
in Figures 6 and 8. These results illustrate that the OLLDa model is superior.

    The sample size of the rst data set equals to 101 observations and the data
set has been taken based on the failure times of Kevlar 49/epoxy strands with
pressure at 90%. It has been originally presented by Barlow, Toland & Freeman
(1984) in which failure times are in hours. The data set has been previously an-
alyzed by Andrews & Herzberg (2012) and Cooray & Ananda (2008). Recently,
Oluyede et al. (2016) used it to t based on the Dagum-Poisson distribution.

    The second data set contains 32 observations corresponding to the birth weights
of newborn babies in ounces (from Armitage & Berry, 1987). Some authors stud-
ied this data set and tted some models for the data set such as Thode (2002, p.
342) and Torabi, Montazeri & Grané (2016).

7. Simulation Study

   In order to assess the performance of the MLEs, a small simulation study is
performed using the statistical software R through the package (stats4), command

MLE. The number of Monte Carlo replications was 20,000. For maximizing the log-
likelihood function, we use the MaxBFGS subroutine with analytical derivatives.
The evaluation of the estimates was performed based on the following quantities for
each sample size: the empirical mean squared errors (MSEs) are calculated using
the R package from the Monte Carlo replications. The MLEs are determined for
each simulated data, say, (α̂i , β̂i , aˆi , bˆi ) for i = 1, 2, . . . , 10, 000 and the biases and
MSEs are computed by
                                                                   10000

                                                     10000 i=1

and
                                                                   10000

                                                     10000 i=1

for h = a, b, c, α. We consider the sample sizes at n = 100, 150 and 300 and consider
dierent values for the parameters. The empirical results are given in Table 3.
The gures in Table 3 indicate that the estimates are quite stable and, more
importantly, are close to the true values for the these sample sizes. Furthermore,
as the sample size increases, the MSEs decreases as expected.
