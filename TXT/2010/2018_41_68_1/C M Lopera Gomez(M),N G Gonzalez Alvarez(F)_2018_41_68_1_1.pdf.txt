Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Medellín, Colombia
Abstract
This paper develops simultaneous condence bands using computer intensive methods based on resampling, for the expected discounted warranty costs in coherent systems under physical minimal repair, that is, when the system is observed at its components level and only the component that causes the fault is minimally repaired. For this purpose, it is shown that, under the framework of the Martingale processes and the central limit resampling theorem (CLRT) over stochastic processes, the discounted warranty cost processes satisfy the conditions set by the central limit resampling theorem (CLRT). Additionally, a simulation study is performed on the most relevant variables, such that the nite sample features of the proposed bands may be assessed, based on their actual coverage probabilities. The results in the considered scenarios show that resampling-based simultaneous condence bands have coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal coverage. In particular, the agreement is good when there are 100 systems or more where a large number of resamples are used for the approximation.

Resumen
Este trabajo desarrolla bandas de conanza simultáneas usando métodos computacionales intensivos basados en remuestreo, para el costo medio de garantía descontado en sistemas coherentes bajo reparo mínimo físico, esto es, cuando el sistema es observado al nivel de sus componentes y sólo la componente que causa la falla es reparada mínimamente. Para ello se prueba que, bajo el marco teórico de los procesos martingala, los procesos de costos de garantía descontados cumplen las condiciones del teorema de límite central de remuestreo (CLRT). Un estudio de simulación Monte Carlo se realiza para evaluar, a través de las probabilidades de cobertura alcanzadas, el desempeño de las bandas propuestas en muestras nitas. Los resultados en los escenarios considerados muestran que las bandas de conanza basadas en remuestreo tienen probabilidades de cobertura con valores cercanos a los esperados, en particular para aquellas basadas en muestras con más de 100 sistemas donde el número de remuestras usado para la aproximación es grande.
Palabras clave convergencia débil; probabilidad de cobertura; proceso puntual; remuestreo; semimartingalas; teorema de límite central.


1. Introduction
    When a manufacturer puts a new product on the market, it is expected that
a warranty program will come along with the product, which could become a
great cost if it is a low-quality product (Thomas 2005).           Bai & Pham (2006)
highlight that warranty analysis is very important for cost modeling, especially
for discounted costs (Blischke & Murthy 1994, Chien 2005, Ja, Kulkarni, Mitra &
Patankar 2002, Murthy & Djamaludina 2002, Nguyen & Murthy 1984). Discounted
warranty cost models consider the product age and provide a proper measurement
of the costs involved in the warranty program, given that they can be treated as
random cash ows. Therefore, it is possible to model their evolution throughout
the lifetime of the product under warranty, as well as to estimate the necessary
fund reserve levels to meet future warranty claims.          Several aspects regarding
discounted warranty costs and their corresponding reserves have been studied by
Bai & Pham (2004), Duchesne & Marri (2009), Ja et al. (2002), Jain & Maheshwari
(2006), Patankar & Mitra (1995), and Thomas (1989).

    In practice, many products consist of several components, that is, the product
can be seen as a system. If every component has its own warranty, they can be
combined to produce one warranty for the system, in which it is necessary to keep
in mind both the system structure and warranty service costs at its component level
(Thomas 1989). Several previous papers have considered warranty cost analysis
for component systems (Ritchken & Fuh 1986, Chukova & Dimitrov 1996, Hussain
& Murthy 1998, Bai & Pham 2006, Balachandran, Maschmeyer & Livingstone
1981, Jung, Park & Park 2010).        There are many ways to model the impact of
repair actions over system failure times.      In literature, it is frequently assumed
that repairing a system leaves it as good as new (Block, Borges & Savits 1985).
Nevertheless, this hypothesis and its implications have been criticized by many
authors on the argument that repairing can only, in many practical cases, restoring
the system back to the performance conditions right before the failure (Block et al.
1985, Ascher 1968, Ouali, Tadj, Yacout & Ait-Kadi 2011), which is called minimal
repair. In complex systems, repairing is frequently assumed as minimal (Blischke &

Condence Bands for the Expected Discounted Warranty Cost of a Coherent System       3



Murthy 1994). The denition of the state of the system immediately before failure
depends on the information level one has about the system (Aven & Jensen 1999),
so that minimal repairs are classied into two types: statistical minimal repair,
which implies replacing the full system for another one just as old as the other one
would be if it had not failed (Nguyen & Murthy 1984, Aven 1983, Sheu, Grith
& Nakagawa 1995, Ja, Kulkarni, Mitra & Patankar 2001), and physical minimal
repair, in which the system is supposed to be observed at its component level and,
therefore, only the critical component that caused the system to fail, gets minimal
repair (Aven & Castro 2008, González & Bueno 2011).

   González & Bueno (2011) propose a Martingale estimator for the expected
discounted warranty costs for a coherent system under physical minimal repair
and include the calculation of specic condence limits which do not make up a
simultaneous condence band, given that the aforementioned set of limits gener-
ally has no correct coverage probability (Fleming & Harrington 1991). The main
purpose of constructing simultaneous condence bands is to assess an estimator's
precision, which can be described by the distribution (or a function of it) of that
estimator's deviations from its real value (Belyaev 2007). The problem is that the
aforementioned distribution is unknown, even if asymptotic convergence results of
distribution can be obtained (González & Bueno 2011). In the practice, sample
sizes are not always large enough for those approximations to work properly. In
general, computer intensive (CI) methods provide a way to nd asymptotically
precise approximations of the estimator deviation distributions from the real un-
known parameters (Belyaev 2000). The bootstrap, introduced by Efron (1979) is
a rather universal method, nevertheless, the need to nd a proper estimator of the
real parameter which can describe data distribution, may be a dicult problem,
which is why resampling can be used alternatively (Belyaev 2000).

   Resampling is used in this paper to develop simultaneous condence bands
for the mean function of the discounted warranty costs of a system under physical
minimal repair. For this, based on the theoretical framework of Martingale process
and the Central Limit of Resampling Theorem (CLRT) over stochastic processes
proposed by Belyaev (2000) and Belyaev & Seleznjev (2000), proof is presented
that the discounted warranty costs processes under the general lifetime model
comply with CLRT conditions.      In addition, a simulation study was conducted
on the most relevant variables to test the nite sample features of the proposed
simultaneous condence bands by means of the actual coverage probability.

   Section 2 presents the theoretical framework that is necessary in the develop-
ment of this paper. The proposal of constructing simultaneous condence bands
is developed in Section 3. In Section 4, the performance of the proposed simul-
taneous condence bands is assessed by means of a simulation study. Section 5
presents the paper's most important conclusions and recommendations.




2. Theoretical Framework
   In this paper it is assumed that there is a coherent system under physical
minimal repair, that is, under the physical approach of the general failure model

(Aven & Jensen 1999).       Next section summarizes some theoretical results which
are necessary for the development of the remaining sections in the paper.



2.1. Physical Minimal Repair Model for a Coherent System
     and Discounted Warranty Costs
    Let us suppose a system with m components, where T is the system lifetime,
Si is the lifetime of component i, i = 1, . . . , m and Ñt is the number of minimal
repairs of the system in the interval [0, t], dened on a complete probability space
(Ω, F, P ) with the ltration F = (Ft )t≥0 ,
                                                                       
                  Ft = σ N es , I (Si > s) , 0 ≤ s ≤ t, i = 1, . . . , m ,       (1)


where I(A) is the indicator of the event A. Therefore, the system repair/failure
process is observed at the level of its m components. Suppose the following con-
ditions are hold:


a)   0 < Si < ∞ P -a.s., i = 1, . . . , m, where P -a.s.             denotes that an event E
     happens almost surely with respect to the probability P .

b) For every i 6= j, P (Si = Sj ) = 0, that is, there are not two components failing
     simultaneously.

c) All lifetimes Si are totally inaccessible Ft -stopping times, and consequently
     all the compensators    Ai of the respective simple counting processes Nti =
     I (Si ≤ t), are continuous P -a.s., with the Doob-Meyer decomposition Nti =
     Ait + Mti , Mti ∈ M20 , i = 1, . . . , m.

     Under these assumptions and according to Aven & Jensen (1999) can be shown
that
                                        T = min Si ,                                       (2)
                                               i:Yi <∞

where Yi is the critical level of component i, that is, the rst instant after which
failure of component i causes the system failure. González & Bueno (2011) show
that the system failure indicator process Nt = I (T ≤ t), given by

                                Nt = At + Mt , Mt ∈ M20 ,                                  (3)


     has the compensator At as follows
                                Z t               m
                                                  X
                       At   =         I (T > s)         I (Yi < s) λi (s) ds,              (4)
                                 0                i=1
         i
where λ (t) is the failure rate function for component i.



     From (4), it is clear that the Ft -intensity of the system on {T > t} is given by

                                        m
                                        X
                                λt =          I (Yi < t) λi (t) .                          (5)

2.3. Simultaneous Condence Bands for Random Functions
     Suppose the goal is to estimate and bound a function f (s) in the interval
[0, t]. That is, given a coverage probability of (1 − γ), we want to nd two random
functions b1 (s) and b2 (s) with the property

                      h                                     iB
                    P b1 (s) ≤ f (s) ≤ b2 (s) , ∀ s ∈ [0, t]A ≈ 1 − γ,          (14)


Except for functions having a very simple structure, there are no simultaneous
condence bands with an exact (1 − γ) coverage probability (Knowles 1988).

                                                                                            √  b(n)      

which satises the desirable coverage probability on the interval [0, t].

useful only when sucient conditions for the convergence of   n ft − f (t) on
reasonable intervals [0, t] are not too restrictive, when qγ (t) is easy to calculate,
and when the resulting bands have appealing properties (Fleming & Harrington
1991). Even when the general conditions for weak convergence could be fullled,
calculating qγ (t) requires determining the limit process sup0≤s≤t |Q (s)| to which
                                     √
the process sup0≤s≤t                     n fbs − f (s)     converges, and this is not easy when only a

sample of n systems is available.

   The following section presents the weak approach of processes introduced by
Belyaev (2000) and Belyaev & Seleznjev (2000) as an extension of weak conver-

2.4. Weakly Approaching Distributions
    Let {L (Un )}n≥1 and {L (Vn )}n≥1 be two sequences of distributions of random
variables Un and Vn which have values on Hn , a metric space with metric dn , and
let Cb (Hn , dn ) be the set of all bounded real-valued continuous functions on Hn .

    Let Wn be a random variable (in a metric space Wn ) dened on the same
probability space of Un previously dened. Suppose that the regular conditional

Lemma 1. (Belyaev 2000) Let Un , Wn and Vn be as dened before. Suppose that
             wa(P )
L (Un | Wn ) ←→ L (Vn ) and let Zn be an Hn -valued random variable dened on
the same probability space of Un , such that Zn −→ 0, n → ∞. Then,

tors, it is necessary to consider more general spaces than R .                For instance, for
many non-parametric statistical models it is necessary to consider the Skorokhod
space D [0, t] , t > 0, of the so-called   cadlag functions. That is, the set of all real
functions v (·) dened in [0, t] such that for all s ∈ (0, t) there are limit values
v (s ± 0) = limh↓0 v (s ± h) and v (s) = v (s + 0).

the conditions      C-1, C-2 and C-3 established in Theorem 4, which is summarized
in the following theorem (see proof in the Appendix B)

Theorem 5. Let Ujn (t) be as dened in (25). Then for every 0 ≤ t1 ≤ s ≤ t2 ≤
t < ∞, there exist positive constants c1 , c2 , c3 and δ > 0, such that

C-1. nE[(Ujn (t2 ) − Ujn (t1 ))2 ] ≤ c1 |t2 − t1 |(1+δ)/2 ,

Condence Bands for the Expected Discounted Warranty Cost of a Coherent System 11

Proof . By applying Theorem 5 over the process Ujn (t), the necessary conditions
for Theorem 4 are obtained, from whose application the result is obtained.


   In practice the processes Ujn (t) are unknown and they need to be estimated.
The following section uses estimations of the processes Ujn (t) to construct simul-
taneous condence bands based on resampling.



3.1. A Proposal for Simultaneous Condence Bands for the
     Expected Warranty Cost
   The unobservable process Ujn (t) can be rewritten as follows:


                                       bjn (t) + U
                             Ujn (t) = U         ejn (t) ,                                 (28)


where


        bjn (t) = √1 B                               ejn (t) = √1 B

                                                                       t   − B ∗
                                                                                 (t)  .
                    n                                            n
                                                                                          ?0
The following result establishes that the weakly approaching of the process U·n (t),
given in (26), is kept in an estimated version of itself.


Corollary 2. The process Ub·n?0 (t) =                        bjn (t) has the property that

is obtained, where U             j=1 Njn − 1 Ujn (t) and U·n (t) =  j=1 Njn − 1

      Pn     ?             e ?0     P
and    j=1 Njn = n). Then, U·n (t) −→ 0, therefore by using Lemma 1 the result
is obtained.


   The latter allows proposing simultaneous condence bands for the expected
discounted warranty cost in coherent systems under physical minimal repair.

Proof . González & Bueno (2011) showed that the process U·n (t) weakly con-
verges in the space D [0, t] to a Gaussian stochastic process denoted by Q (t) which
implies
                                                   w
                             sup |U·n (s)| −→ sup |Q (s)| .                              (32)
                             0≤s≤t                     0≤s≤t

By following the denition of simultaneous condence bands introduced in Section
2.3 and from (32) the idea is nding qγ (t) such that:
                                                    
                         P       sup |Q (s)| ≤ qγ (t) ≈ 1 − γ,                           (33)
                                 0≤s≤t

where the process  sup |Q (s)|, to which the process sup |U·n (s)| weakly con-
                  0≤s≤t                              0≤s≤t
verges is unknown. Using Corollary 1

                        ?0
                                           wa(P )
                     L U·n (t) Un           ←→ L (U·n (t)) , n → ∞.
                                                                                         ?
     Thus, instead of nding qγ (t) satisfying (33), the purpose is obtaining qγ (t)
such that:                                                    
                                          ?0
                        P       sup      U·n (s)   ≤ qγ? (t)       ≈ 1 − γ.              (34)
                                0≤s≤t
                                                                          ?
This is equivalent, using Corollary 2, to nd the value of qγ (t) such that

                                                   
                                      ?0       ?
                        P       sup U·n (s) ≤ qγ (t) ≈ 1 − γ.
                                    b                                                    (35)
                                0≤s≤t

          ?
Thus, qγ (t) can be chosen as the (1 − γ) quantile of the empirical distribution
                                       ?0
based on resampling from         sup U
                                     b·n  (s) . Thus, considering that

where A = {t0 = 0 ≤ t1 ≤ · · · ≤ tM −1 ≤ tM = t} is a partition of interval [0, t],

4. Simulation Study
     This section uses simulation to assesses the properties of the proposed simulta-
neous condence bands. The simulation study considers dierent scenarios which
depend on factors that may aect the performance of the bands established in
Theorem 6.

Condence Bands for the Expected Discounted Warranty Cost of a Coherent System 13

4.1. Simulation Factors and Parameters
   The following are the factors considered in the simulation study:


   • System type. A three-component parallel system and a 2-out-of-4 compo-
     nents system are considered. To avoid confusion, both systems are treated as
     k -out-of-m systems, which are denoted by: a) Φ1:3
                                                    t   for the three-components
                                                                 2:4
     parallel system or 1-out-of-3 components system, and b) Φt      for the 2-out-
     of-4 components system.

   • Number of systems under warranty. This is denoted by n and corre-
     sponds to the number of independent and identical copies of the repair/cost
     process used for constructing simultaneous condence bands.             The levels
     considered are n = 10, 30, 50, 100, 500 and 1000.

   • Discount function.        Denoted by    Hi (t) describes the consumer share of
     physical minimal repair costs for the system during the W warranty term.
     Hi (t) = ci e−t , ci 1 − tW −1 e−t , i = 1, . . . , m were used.
                                   

   • Number of resamples. This is denoted by G. The levels of G are 500,
     1000, 5000 and 10000.

   • Partition size. This is denoted by M and it determines how thin is the
     partition of the warranty period, for the approximation of the supreme of
     the limit process given in (32). The levels of M are 100, 500 and 1000.


   Table 1 summarizes the levels considered in the simulation factors.

   The following are xed values or simulation parameters:


   • Component failure distributions. For the systems considered (Φ1:3     t  and
     Φ2:4
       t  ) in each component i, whose associated lifetime is denoted Si , the re-
     spective cumulative distribution function Fi is considered, thus: Fi (t) =
     Weibull(η = 1.0, β = 1.5), i = 1, 2; Fi (t) = Weibull(η = 2.0, β = 2.0),
     i = 3, 4.
   • Warranty term. W denotes the time period within which the system is
     under warranty. The simulation uses W = 5. This can be interpreted as
     representing ve years or ve thousand use cycles.

   • Minimal repair cost by component. It corresponds to the minimal repair
     value in the i-th component and is denoted ci . For this study, c1 = c2 = 3
     and c3 = c4 = 5 were considered.

     • Nominal coverage probability. Denoted by (1 − γ). It species the ex-
        pected probability that the true mean cost function is bounded. A value of
        (1 − γ) = 0.95 was considered.

     • Number of simulations. This is denoted by N . A total of N = 10000
        simulations were used.


     The Weibull distribution for component lifetime was chosen for its frequent use
in industrial reliability. Besides, the values of Weibull distribution parameters set
for each component ensure the distributions have increasing failure rates, and a
record of failures with at least one event during the established warranty term. The
constrains F1 ≡ F2 and F3 ≡ F4 were used to simplify the simulation scenarios.

     Table 2 summarizes the xed values for the parameters considered in the sim-
ulation study.

     The purpose, at this point, is to assess the performance of the simultaneous
condence band proposed in each scenario, by estimating the coverage probabili-
ties.



4.2. Coverage Probabilities
               (n)                                                                     ∗
     Let SCBt        be a simultaneous condence band for the function B                   (t) in [0, t],
                                                                                                    (n)
based on a sample of n systems, then the coverage probability (CP) for SCBt                               is
dened as:                                                              
                                                                   (n)
                                CP = P             B ∗ (t) ∈ SCBt            .                       (38)

                                                    (n)
If simultaneous condence band SCBt                       has a (1 − γ) level, then CP ≈ 1 − γ .

     The following is the procedure followed during the simulations:

the actual coverage probabilities increase because the larger number of resamples.
Figure 2 shows that the dierences in actual coverage probabilities achieved by the
two discount functions decrease when the number of systems increases, reaching
values close to the nominal level of (1 − γ) used in the simulation.

     Figure 3 shows that, similar to, the 1-out-of-3 system, when the number of
systems under warranty increases, the actual coverage probabilities of the simulta-
neous condence bands increase toward the condence level (1 − γ). At each level
of the partition size M , the smaller coverage probabilities suggest an improvement
when the resample size G increases. It is worth noting that there are large dif-
ferences between the coverage probabilities for both discount functions when the
number of systems is smaller or equal than 100. But similar values to the nominal
(1 − γ) level are achieved in both discount functions when the number of systems
is greater than 100.



4.5. Examples of Simultaneous Condence Bands
     Simultaneous condence bands are illustrated with simulated data for both
the 1-out-of-3 components system and the 4-out-of-2 components system for xed
values: W = 5; α = 0.05; c1 = c2 = 3; c3 = c4 = 5; Fi (t) = Weibull(η =
1.0, β = 1.5), i = 1, 2; Fi (t) = Weibull(η = 2.0, β = 2.0), i = 3, 4; M = 1000 and
R = 10000.
     Figures 4 and 5 show the precision changes within the simultaneous condence
bands when the number of systems n under warranty varies, for the 1-out-of-3 and
2-out-of-4 components systems, respectively.

     Notice that for both systems in the study, the number of systems under war-
ranty is a key factor in the precision of the proposed simultaneous condence
bands.   Observe that the bands are narrow when n ≥ 500.           Few systems under
warranty (n ≤ 100) generate high variability of the estimation of the expected
discounted warranty cost as reected in wider simultaneous condence bands.




5. Conclusions and Future Research
     For some statistical models, assessment of the precision of the statistical infer-
ences may be carried out by means of intensive computer methods (Efron 1979,
Davison & Hinkley 1997, Belyaev 2007). Resampling was eciently used in this
work to obtain simultaneous condence bands, for the expected discounted war-
ranty cost under physical minimal repair. This is a useful tool to assess the pre-
cision of the estimator, avoiding the complications of the asymptotic analysis of
the related stochastic processes. For instance, it avoids nding the specic distri-
butions for those processes. Besides, it is worth noting that the technique used to
estimate the warranty costs, and the subsequent computation of the simultaneous
condence bands is non-parametric, and therefore no distributional assumption
about the failure/repair processes is required by the proposed method.

     The proposed computation of the simultaneous condence bands is valid in a
wide range of models that satisfy with the general conditions identied in Section
2.

     The proposed computation of the simultaneous condence bands for the ex-
pected discounted warranty cost of coherent systems under minimal repair is easy
to implement in current statistical package, since it only involves random sam-
pling with replacement.          Also, in the simulation scenarios studied in Section 4,
reasonable actual coverage probabilities were obtained, particularly when it there
was a number of systems under warranty greater than 100, a ne partition of the
warranty term and a large number of resamples.

     This paper has focused on the minimal repair model and on the warranty pol-
icy in which repair cost is shared by both the customer and the manufacturer
(PRW policy). In the literature there are references to other types of repair be-
sides minimal repair, such as: perfect repair, in which the product is as good as
new after repair, and imperfect repair, in which the product is better than used,
but not as good as new.          Both types of repair make use of well-known renewal
processes (Park & Pham 2010, Su & Shen 2012). In addition, it is possible to con-
sider Free Replacement Policies (FRW) or combination of FRW and PRW policies

Proposition A.1. Let H (t) be a non-negative, bounded and continuous func-
tion, in [a, b] with 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ t < ∞. Let λ (t) be a non-negative function
representing a failure rate that is likely to be associated to an increasing failure
rate (IFR) distribution, or to a decreasing failure rate (DFR) distribution, or with
one  mixing both patterns, for instance a bathtub-shape failure rate. Assume that
      (u) λ (u) du < ∞, that is f (t) = H (t) λ (t) is Riemann integrable in [a, b].

 where the second inequality holds because for every 0 ≤ t1 ≤ s ≤ t2 ≤ t < ∞,
|t2 − s| ≤ |t2 − t1 |, |s − t1 | ≤ |t2 − t1 |, and the fourth inequality is given because
there is a κ3 > 0 such that |t2 − t1 | ≤ κ3 .



Proof of condition C -3
   Consider δ = 1. We want to show that
                                            h√                         i

Using (25), the triangular inequality, and that g (x) = x                               is increasing when x ≥ 0,
it can shown that

                             √                  3

in [0, t], there is 0 < υ < ∞ such that Hi (s) ≤ υ for every i = 1, . . . , m and since
g (x) = x3 with x ≥ 0, is an increasing function, from (B12), it follows that
