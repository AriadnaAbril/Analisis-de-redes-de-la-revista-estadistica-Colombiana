A Statistical Model for Analyzing Interdependent Complex of Plant Pathogens. Un modelo estadístico para analizar complejos interdependientes de patógenos vegetales
Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia
Abstract
We introduce a new approach for modeling multivariate overdispersed binomial data, from a plant pathogen complex. After recalling some theoretical foundations of generalized linear models (GLMs) and Copula functions, we show how the later can be used to model correlated observations and overdispersed data. We illustrate this approach using fungal incidence in vegetables, which we analyzed using Gaussian copula with Beta-binomial margins. Compared to classical and generalized linear models, the model using Gaussian copula function best controls for overdispersion, being less prone to the underestimation of standard errors, the major cause of wrong inference in the statistical analysis of plant pathogen complex.
Key words: Epidemiological methods, Extra-binomial variation, Multivariate data.
Resumen
Se introduce un nuevo enfoque para modelar datos binomiales multivariados con sobredispersión, obtenidos de complejos de patógenos vegetales. Después de revisar los conceptos básicos de los modelos lineales generalizados (GLMs) y las funciones Cópula, se muestra cómo estas últimas pueden usarse para modelar observaciones correlacionadas y datos con sobredispersión. Se ilustra el método usando la incidencia de hongos en hortalizas, analizando el caso por medio de la función cópula Gaussiana con marginales Beta-binomiales. Comparado con los modelos lineales clásicos y generalizados, el modelo construido con la cópula Gaussiana es el que mejor controla la sobredispersión, siendo menos propenso a la subestimación de los errores estándar, la causa más importante de inferencia inapropiada en el análisis estadístico de complejos de patógenos vegetales.

1. Introduction
    The use of single-parameter family of distributions can sometimes be problem-
atic for statistical inference (Cox 1983). For example, in the binomial distribution
the variance is totally determined by the mean, and when this is satisfied there is
nominal dispersion, an assumption that cannot be hold in some data analyses. In
fact, vector data may display a lack of independence as is commonly the case in
experimental trials in plant pathology; in these data, the presence of a fungus of-
ten increases the probability of damage in neighboring leaves, leading to marginal
dependence in the data. Moreover, the analysis of plant-pathogen complex can
also be complicated by the presence of multivariate dependence, as was shown by
Dávila (2005).
    To get a correct analysis of multivariate binomial data, an overdispersion diag-
nostic is necessary in order to compare the nominal dispersion against the actual
dispersion. To this end, Smith & Heitjan (1993) provided an appropriate statisti-
cal tool to detect extra binomial variation. McCullagh & Nelder (1989) maintain
that “overdispersion is a common attribute of data arising in many fields, and sta-
tistical practitioners shall assume that overdispersion is present in some extent”.
Accordingly, there are two main approaches to deal with univariate overdispersion:
First, the use of full parametric models like dispersion models (Joe 1997), and sec-
ond, the choice of families of estimating functions (Heyde 1997). In the case of
multivariate data, multivariate dispersion models (Jørgensen & Lauritzen 2000)
and copula function based models (Song, Li & Yuan 2009) can be used.
    The literature on copula model with count data is not abundant, with some
references in financial and actuarial sciences. Nikoloulopoulos & Karlis (2010)
present a recent review for the use of this methodology with application to discrete
data in marketing exchanges. Some applied works have been done in joint modeling
of correlated data using Gaussian copulae (Song et al. 2009). Furthermore, a recent
approximation to the Gaussian copula likelihood is given in Madsen & Fang (2011),
who found that for finite samples the estimator of generalized estimating equations
is more efficient than the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, Song,
Li & Yuan (2011) maintain that MLE is more efficient.
    With respect to applications in the biological sciences, the next are some useful
references. Lambert & Vandenhende (2002) propound a model for non-normal lon-
gitudinal data with illustration in a dose titration safety study in human medicine.
A work in multivariate logistic regression was presented by Li & Wong (2011)
and, because of a lack of constraints in the parameters and the admission of
a limited range of dependence in the copula, this paper was criticized and cor-
rected (Nikoloulopoulos 2012). A more basic study was carried out by Trégouët,

Statistical Model for Plant Pathogens                                                  257

Ducimetière, Bocquet, Visvikis, Soubrier & Tiret (1999), with binary data on nu-
clear families, in this analysis the response was the presence or the absence of a
disease in each member of the family.
    In the particular situation of plant-disease complex, the presence of two or more
pathogenic fungi can be strongly correlated, thereby violating the assumption of
independence amongst observations (Dávila 2005, Dávila & López 2010). In such
a situation, it is necessary to use a statistical model with multivariate distributions
which include both marginal overdispersion and multivariate dependence (Fischer
2011, Joe 1997, Song 2007).
    Ultimately, in relation to the disadvantages of copula-based analysis of count
data, two important references shall be mentioned: Genest & Nešlehovà (2007)
for details on the danger and limitations of the use of copulae to model discrete
data, and Embrechts (2009) who in a personal view gives some review on this
theory, recommends some important lectures and analyzes future developments.
Additionally, the reader is encouraged to review the controversial article of Mikosch
(2006), which is a critical point of view of copula methodology, with discussion and
rejoinder. Despite some problems in copula modeling with discrete data, nowadays
this model constructions are valid but subject to cautions.
    The present paper contains four sections. Section 2 presents the characteriza-
tion of multivariate vectors, reviews some concepts on overdispersion diagnostics
and model selection. Section 3 is dedicated to theoretical details of the proposed
model. Section 4 shows an application to empirical data in diseases management
on vegetables. Finally, Section 5 presents discussions and conclusion.


2. Material and Methods
    In this section we present the characterization of data and parameter vectors,
overdispersion diagnostic and a short reminder on copula theory and model selec-
tion.


2.1. Structure of data and parameter vectors
   In plant pathology studies, data are typically made of binomial observations
representing the presence/absence of pathogenic fungi. Data obtained for d fungi
are modeled by a d-variate vector:

                                Y = (Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yd )T                           (1)

where Yi is a binomial random variable associated to the incidence of the ith
fungus, i = 1, 2, . . . , d. A common assumption is that the probabilistic mechanism
that generates marginal data is the binomial law, whose density with respect to
the counting measure is given by
                                                 
                                                 m i yi
                          fYi (yi | πi , mi ) =      πi (1 − πi )mi −yi           (2)
                                                 yi

                                        Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 255–270

where yi = 0, 1, . . . , mi and with given probability of success πi ; we write formally
that Yi ∼ bin(mi , πi ), with
                                      E[Yi ] = mi πi
and
                        V ar[Yi ] = mi πi (1 − πi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , d                  (3)

   Provided that multivariate data are generated by the same designed experi-
ment, there is an identical design matrix X associated to any margin Yi ; hence, un-
der the GLM framework, the three components are (see McCullagh & Nelder 1989):

   1. The class of densities in (2) with πi varying in the interval (0, 1), which
      belongs to the exponential family of distributions,
   2. The systematic part Xθi , where X is a n×p matrix andθi = (θi1 , θi2 , . . . , θip )T
                                                        πi
      is a vector of unknown parameters with θi = ln 1−π   i
                                                             , and
   3. The link function gi (·).

    In GLM modeling, it is supposed that there is independence between any subset
of random variables from (1) and that (3) holds.
    Because this work is dealing with the lack of independence and overdispersion
(V ar[Yi ]  mi πi (1 − πi )), a natural characteristic of multivariate data arising
in plant-disease complex, then a new model shall be considered. Hence a full
likelihood inference procedure requires a family of distributions with a great vector
of total marginal parameters

                                  Θ = (θ1T , θ2T , . . . , θdT )T

and an association matrix
                                                                 

                              21                                 
                              .             .          .      . 
                                                                 
                           Γ=

                                                                  
                                                                 
                              .             .                 . 
                               γd1          γd2     .   .   . γdd

where γii∗ , i 6= i∗ , i∗ , i = 1, 2, . . . , d, will be taking in account the bivariate asso-
ciation between each pair of transformed margins; the construction of the desired
multivariate distribution is the objective of the Section 3. However, an important
prerequisite lies in the detection of extra binomial variation, which we now detail.


2.2. Overdispersion Diagnostic
   To test the nominal dispersion in the ith margin, it is important to give an
extension of (3), i.e.,

                             V ar[Yi ] = λi mi πi (1 − πi ),


                                          Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 255–270

Statistical Model for Plant Pathogens                                                                    259

and the hypothesis testing problem is formulated for all i = 1, 2, . . . , d as

                            H0i : λi = 1 versus H1i : λi > 1                                             (4)

   An appropriate procedure to test (4) is the score statistic of Smith and Heitjan
(1993), viz.

                             χ2i = JiT A−1
                                        i Ji , i = 1, 2, . . . , d                                       (5)

where Ji = (Ji1. , Ji2. , . . . , Jip. ) is a random vector that registers the difference be-
tween actual information and nominal information, in the ith margin with respect
to every jth parameter, namely


                  n
                       "           2                      #
                                                 ∂ 2 lijk
                                             
              1X            ∂lijk
       Jij. =                            −            2          j = 1, . . . , p, i = 1, 2, . . . , d   (6)
              2             ∂θij                  ∂θij
                 k=1

and Ai is the covariance matrix of Ji corrected for estimation of θi , whose explicit
expressions are given in the appendix of Smith & Heitjan’s (1993) paper.
    In equation (6), lijk is the log-likelihood of the binomial distribution presented
in (2). Hence, for each ith margin with respect to the jth parameter and the kth
observation, we have
                                           
                                     πijk
                 lijk = yijk ln               + mijk ln(1 − πijk )
                                   1 − πijk

and
         n
           "                                  #
       1X
Jij. =                      2
             (yijk − mi πi ) − mi πi (1 − πi ) x2ijk , j = 1, . . . , p, i = 1, 2, . . . , d
       2
          k=1


    Under the null hypothesis of nominal dispersion (4), the asymptotic distribu-
tion of (5) is the central χ2 -distribution with p degrees of freedom. The eventual
reject of (4) will be a clear evidence that V ar[Yi ]  mi πi (1 − πi ); namely, actual
variance is statistically greater than the nominal one.
    Hitherto, we have been dealing with marginal overdispersion, whereas the sta-
tistical problem in plant-pathogen complex data includes both marginal overdis-
persion and multivariate dependence. In the following, we show how the latter
can be addressed using copulae theory.


2.3. Basics on Copula Modeling
    An interesting concept for connecting multivariate cumulative distribution func-
tions and their margins is offered by copulae theory (see Joe 1997, Nelsen 2006).
A mapping C : [0, 1]d → [0, 1] is called a d-dimensional copula, if it is the dis-
tribution of a uniform vector U = (U1 , U2 , . . . , Ud ); that is, copulae are joint
distribution functions of standard uniform random variates (Cherubini, Luciano


                                                  Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 255–270

260                           Eduardo Dávila, Luis Alberto López & Luis Guillermo Díaz


& Vecchiato 2004). Because any marginal distribution function Fi has a uniform
distribution, i.e. Fi (y) ∼ U (0, 1) with i = 1, 2, . . . , d, the use of copulae has be-
come evident in the last few years, to construct dependency models (Härdle &
Simar 2007).
    The application of copulae to statistical modeling is based on Sklar’s theorem
(Nelsen 2006); this useful theorem states that given marginal distributions, it is
possible to couple these margins into a joint distribution whose arguments are
the Fi ’s; provided that the margins are continuous, this kind of representation
is unique. Hence, following Grønneberg (2011), there are four basic problems in
parametric modeling through copulae theory, namely:

   • How to estimate the dependence parameter?

   • How should the parametric form of the copula family be chosen?

   • How to select among several candidate models on the basis of actual data?

   • Is the final model adequate?

    The scientific context of plant pathology gives us preliminary responses for the
first two items, whereas the two later are pure statistical modeling steps and will
be reviewed in the following.


2.4. Model Selection and Goodness of Fit
   A usual tool for model selection is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
which is not appropriate when dealing with semi-parametric estimation, a common
method used in the construction of copulae. A proper generalization of AIC, given
in Grønneberg (2011), is the Copula Information Criterion (CIC), viz.

                                           p∗ + qb∗ + rb∗ )
                         CIC = 2lN,max − 2(b                                              (7)

where lN,max is the maximum multivariate pseudo-likelihood. The second term of
(7) has a more elaborate formula than in AIC –where it depends only on the length
of parameter vector. If the model is correctly specified, then qb∗ = 0. Details for
deriving the estimates of pb∗ , qb∗ and rb∗ from empirical information, and least false
copula derivatives are given in Grønneberg (2011).
   Genest, Rémillard & Beaudoin (2009) provide a useful tool to test the final
model adequacy. Let H be a joint cumulative distribution function the copula
representation of H is

               H(y1 , y2 , . . . , yd ) = C(F1 (y1 ), F2 (y2 ), . . . , Fd (yd ))         (8)

provided that C is unknown to model Y = (Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yd )T , we suppose that C
belongs to a class

                          C = {Cω : ω ∈ Ω}, Ω ⊆ Rd , d ≥ 1                                (9)


                                           Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 255–270

Statistical Model for Plant Pathogens                                                      261

so we must test,
                        H0 : C ∈ C          versus           /C
                                                      H1 : C ∈                            (10)

   Genest et al. (2009) advocate the use of “blanket test”, based on the empirical
copula, viz.,
                                      N
                                 1 X b
                    CN (u) =        I(Ul ≤ u), u ∈ [0, 1]d                                (11)
                                 N
                                      l=1

where U b l is a vector of pseudo-observations, whose components are the empirical
cumulative distribution functions related to each margin, obtained from actual
data, i.e.,
                     b l = (Fbl,1 , . . . , Fbl,d ), l = 1, 2, . . . , N
                     U
with N being the size of a random sample from (1); it is important to recall
that, under probability transformations, it is expected that Fbl,i ∼ U (0, 1) for all
l = 1, 2, . . . , N and i = 1, 2, . . . , d. The empirical copula (11) is a consistent
estimator of C in (8), and the statistic to test H0 in (10) is
                                N
                                X
                       SN =       {CN (U           b l )}2
                                       b l ) − Cω (U                                      (12)
                                                 N
                                l=1

    The asymptotic distribution of (12) cannot be directly tabulated, then approx-
imations of p-values shall be obtained via bootstrap-based procedures. Because of
its high computational cost, Kojadinovic, Yan & Holmes (2011) recently proposed
a fast large-sample testing procedure based on multiplier central limit theorems.
    Now that we have recalled the basics of model selection and goodness of fit
tests, we can introduce our alternative model for the statistical analysis of plant-
pathogen complex.


3. A Model for Multivariate Overdispersed
   Binomial Data
    Here the objective is to present an alternative statistical model to analyze
plant-pathogen complex data. More specifically, we shall focus on the analysis
of designed experiments to evaluate substances as possible activators of Systemic
Acquired Resistance (SAR) (Durrant & Dong 2004). Because SAR is a mecha-
nism which confers a broad spectrum of protection against plant pathogens, it is
expected that all fungi in a complex should be affected and that multivariate data
should not present independence; additionally, the natural spreading of pathogen
inoculum cannot guarantee marginal independency, then marginal overdispersion
can be a natural attribute of such data.
    We are going to construct the desired model in two steps, first, fitting margins
to an appropriate family of distribution, and second, modeling the given margins
in a Gaussian copula family framework.

3.1. Marginal Overdispersion Model
    In order to model marginal overdispersion, we make use of Beta-binomial hi-
erarchy, a generalization of binomial distribution (Casella & Berger 2002). In
this model, it is supposed that Yi | Pi ∼ bin(mi , Pi ), whereas Pi ∼ Beta(αi , βi ).
Then, from now on, we make the assumption that each margin (Yi ) follows a Beta-
binomial law. Therefore, unconditionally the compound density, with respect to
the counting measure of Yi , is given by

                            mi B(yi + αi , mi − yi + βi )
     fYi (yi | αi , βi ) =                                , yi ∈ {0, 1, . . . , mi } (13)

furthermore, in (13) B(., .) is the beta function, αi > 0 and βi > 0. Conditional
to Pi the expectation is given by
                                                       αi
              E(Yi | Pi ) = µi = mi πi = mi                 , i = 1, 2, . . . , d
                                                    αi + βi

the conditional variance is
                                            αi + βi + mi
         V ar(Yi | Pi )    = mi πi (1 − πi )
                                             αi + βi + 1
                           = mi πi (1 − πi ){1 + φi (mi − 1)},                i = 1, 2, . . . , d   (14)

from (14) we can see that the marginal dispersion parameter is

                                                 1
                                     φi =
                                            αi + βi + 1

    Comparing (3) with (14) it is noted that the later has a greater variance, whose
increment is given by a function of φi and the marginal binomial index mi . The
R package VGAM and its function vglm is actually an alternative to fit marginal
responses with Beta-binomial distribution.


3.2. Multivariate Model
    Given the marginal distributions F1 (Y1 ), F2 (Y2 ), . . . , Fd (Yd ) from Beta-binomial
hierarchies (13) and using the Sklar’s theorem, a new family of d-variate distribu-
tions can be obtained and represented by

            CΦ (U1 , U2 , . . . , Ud ) = H (F1 (Y1 ), F2 (Y2 ), . . . , Fd (Yd ) | Γ)               (15)

where H is the d-variate Gaussian distribution with correlation matrix Γ and, in
presence of continuous margin, the density is given by

                                                                        d
                                                                        Y
      fY (y; µ, φ, Γ) = cΦ {F1 (y1 ), F2 (y2 ), . . . , Fd (yd ) | Γ}         f (yi ; πi , φi )
                                                                        i=1


                                            Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 255–270

Statistical Model for Plant Pathogens                                                             263

where π T = (π1 , π2 , . . . , πd ) ∈ [0, 1]d is the main vector of marginal parameters
and φT = (φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φd ) ∈ Rd is the ancillary vector of marginal dispersion pa-
rameters. Because (13) is a discrete distribution, then we use the more appropriate
expression

  P (Y1 = y1 , Y2 = y2 , . . . , Yd = yd ) =
                    2 X
                    X 2                 2
                                        X
                                  ···       (−1)j1 +j2 +...+jd CΦ (u1j1 , u2j2 , . . . , udjd | Γ) (16)
                    j1 =1 j2 =1         jd =1

with ui1 = Fi (yi ) and ui2 = Fi (yi − 1) i = 1, 2, . . . , d, which is the density with
respect to the counting measure, namely the Radon-Nikodym derivative of (15).


3.3. Two Step Inference
   To make inference on (16) we use the two parts inference procedure, proposed
by Joe (1997). In this methodology, in the first step the margins are fitted from
(13) and because it is composed of common functions, both numerical methods
or maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are applicable; see Griffiths (1973) for
details. The R package VGAM makes use of Fisher scoring for estimation and it
operates quite well for overdispersed binomial data. In a particular situation, to
model g(πi ) = Xθi , the score equation, for maximum likelihood estimation from
(13), is

                     n
  ∂li             X                                                         1
      = (αi +βi )    ddg(yi , (αi +βi )πi )−ddg(mi −yi , (αi +βi )(1−πi )) 0       xjk
  ∂θi                                                                      g (πi )
                    k=1

j = 1, . . . , p, where ddg(a, b) = log Γ(a + b) − log Γ(b); additional details can be
seen in Hinde & Demetrio (1998).
    The second step deals with the selection of an appropriate family of copulae. In
the case of Gaussian copula, for the estimation of Γ, can be used some assumptions
like the presence of exchangeable Pearson correlation matrix, i.e., γii∗ = γ, i 6= i∗ ;
in any case, from (16) the solution of

                           ∂CΦ (u1j1 , u2j2 , . . . , udjd | Γ)
                                                                =0
                                         ∂Γ
can be obtained using the Gaussian-Hermite quadrature method (see McCulloch,
Searly & Neuhaus 2008, pp. 326-331). Finally, consider the vector of marginal
and multivariate parameters

                     η = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θd , γ12 , γ13 , . . . , γ(d−1)(d) )

in order to complete the inference procedure; following Joe (1997), it is necessary
to estimate the inverse Godambe information matrix

                                    V = Dh−1 Mh (Dh−1 )T                                          (17)


                                                Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 255–270

264                           Eduardo Dávila, Luis Alberto López & Luis Guillermo Díaz


where Dh = E[∂hT (Y, η)/∂η] and Mh = E[hT (Y, η)h(Y, η)], with h being the first
derivative of the logarithm of (16) with respect to η. The estimation of N −1 V ,
which is the asymptotic covariance matrix of the MLE of η, namely ηb, can be done
via Jackknife, viz.,
                                 N
                                 X
                            ==                            η (l) − ηb)
                                            η (l) − ηb)T (b
                                           (b                                               (18)
                                     l=1


      In (18), ηb(l) is the estimator of η once the lth observation has been eliminated.


4. Application
    Cely (1996) carried out a trial in Colombia in an onion crop, in order to analyze
the effect of seven treatments, based on the aspersion of inactive inoculum of the
plant pathogen Peronospora destructor for cross protection, an approach later
included in the SAR methods by Durrant & Dong (2004). The experiment was
located under a complete randomized block design, with two blocks (the crop
varieties Junca and Monguana). Three responses were captured as binomial data,
all of them associated to the incidence of a pathogenic fungus; namely Y1 represents
the downy mildew Peronospora sp., Y2 the leaf blight Stemphylium sp. and Y3 the
leaf spot Cladosporium sp.; so the dependent response vector to be modeled is

                                           Y = (Y1 , Y2 , Y3 )

    Initially, nominal dispersion was rejected with p-values less than 0.05, for all
three margins with respect to the hypothesis testing problem in (4); furthermore,
marginal Beta-binomial hierarchy models (13) were fitted; then, given the three
CDF’s F1 (y1 ), F2 (y2 ), F3 (y3 ) a 3-variate Gaussian copula model was fitted, ac-
cording to (16). To select the model on the basis of observed data, we use Copula
Information Criterion (7), and the goodness of fit was based on Genest et al. (2009);
finally, applying Jackknife method (18), the Godambe’s asymptotic covariance ma-
trix was estimated. About marginal dispersion parameters, the nominal dispersion
(4) was not rejected, under 3-variate framework, for Y2 , i.e., φ2 ' 0 for the random
variable associated to Stemphylium fungus, an endemic plant pathogen; see Table
1.

    The standard errors of the parameter estimators appear on Table 2 for normal
linear models (MVN) with Box and Cox transformations –the original model used

by Cely (1996)–, generalized linear model (GLM), marginal overdispersion model
(ODM), and multivariate overdispersion model with Gaussian copula and Beta-
binomial margins (CGB). As it can be seen, ODM and CGB are the models with
less significant effects. In fact, both ODM and CGB show a total of six standard
errors associated with significant estimations; nevertheless, without differences in
relation to the number of significant effects, CGB offers higher values of standard
errors.
  With respect to the estimation of the association parameters, the correlation
matrix, i.e.,

                              0.475 ∗ ∗    0.688 ∗ ∗    1.000
shows a positive dependence between normal scores; all three estimations were
highly significant (p-value < 0.0001), leading to the consideration that the appro-
priate copula, for the analyzed data, is not the independent one.

    In relation to the early work of Cely (1996), the author made use of the as-
sumption of independence between the three count variables; hence, let’s see that
a wrong assumption can lead to an incorrect inference. In the original report of
Cely, the SAR-treatment (T2), with respect to the random variable Y2 , was con-
sidered a significant one, i.e., it was statistically different from chemical and mixed

treatments and its use was not taken account: why shall a small difference lead to
significant effect? The answer is an underestimation of standard error, given by
lack of independence and marginal overdispersion, that were not considered in the
assumed probability model.
    In this new data analysis, based on dependence concepts, the treatment T2
does not have differences with respect to chemical and mixed ones, according to
response Y2 ; therefore, the new position will be that T2 is a good solution to
implement an integrated pathogen handing in that crop, because it controls the
three pathogens together with statistical significance. In Table 3 we present two
inferential situations; first, the analysis under MVN, whose significant effects are
represented by “∗”; second, the analysis via CGB, whose significant effects are
indicated by “”. Because in CGB the treatment T2 is statistically similar to the
chemical ones, this new analysis is in favour of T2, the natural SAR-fungicide.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
    Gaussian copulae theory is suitable to construct models with given non-normal
margins, which is the particular situation in plant diseases control. A very impor-
tant issue in model selection is the context, i.e., all modeling shall have scientific
foundations and clear proposals (Claeskens & Hjort 2008). Because the application
of some therapies associates to natural resistance activation (SAR methodologies)
on plants against fungi has a broad spectrum, the lack of independence between
the incidence of pathogens is evident, and then the use of independent marginal
models is out of scientific context.
   Also, it is important to stress the difference of the present methodology with
respect to the works of Song et al. (2009) and Song (2000), which is the use of
margins not belonging to the class of dispersion models (Jørgensen 1997) in our
proposal. Here we are using a Beta-binomial hierarchy to deal with marginal
overdispersion, a new application to copulae theory in the broad field of plant
pathology, a methodology appropriate to modeling SAR-based experiments, the
ones that require modern statistical tools.
   It is worth to recall some limitations of the proposed model, according to the
work of Genest & Nešlehovà (2007). The first limitation is the lack of uniqueness

of the copula, once the random variables put their mass on few atoms: it is a
crucial aspect in binary data and less important if the binomial index tends to
infinity in binomial variables. Accordingly, practitioners may be cautious in the
use of the present methodology with sparse data, that is, when the binomial index
is small (mi < 6), our model is not appropriate.
     A second aspect of copula-based regression for discrete data is that dependence
is not only a function of the copula; additionally, Kendall’s tau an Spearman’s rho
may not span the entire interval [−1, 1]. About this weakness, the use of Gaussian
copula guarantees that the association parameter, i.e., the Pearson correlation co-
efficient, can reach the Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds (Song 2007). Nevertheless, these
dependence parameters are governing the association but they do not have direct
interpretation. That is, the correlation between normal scores is not the same
that the one between the actual variables; hence, we may interpret Γ as a depen-
dence parameter matrix, all but as a correlation matrix of the original binomial
variables. Furthermore, because the margins also characterize the dependence in
the copula, when dealing with discrete data we may consider a conditional copula
model, where the association parameters are varying with the covariates (see Acar,
Craiu & Yao 2011).
    Even if the conditions under which the dependence parameters are estimable
are not elucidated, hitherto the maximum likelihood estimation is a valid method-
ology for inference. Hence, no further discussion on this topic are exposed here
(Genest & Nešlehovà 2007).
    In conclusion, we have that in our example, the model based on Gaussian copula
(CGB) displayed the highest standard errors associated to parameter estimators,
suggesting that this approach controlled the overdispersion in the data. Addi-
tionally, it considers both marginal overdispersion and multivariate dependence,
whereas the marginal overdispersion model, based on independent Beta-binomial
hierarchy (ODM), assigns multivariate dependence to a marginal overdispersion.
Provided that multivariate dependence is present, application shows that normal
linear models (MVN) does not differ from modeling via GLM without overdis-
persion fit, leading to a wrong multivariate inference. The model constructed via
Gaussian copula with Beta-binomial margins (CGB) is probably preferable for
analyzing overdispersed and non-sparse multivariate binomial data, whereas the
classical multivariate normal linear model is not appropriate in such situations.
