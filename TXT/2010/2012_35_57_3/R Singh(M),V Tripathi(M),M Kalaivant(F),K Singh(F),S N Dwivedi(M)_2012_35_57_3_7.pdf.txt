Abstract
The present study uses data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS-1) 1992-93 (International Institute for Population Sciences 1995) conducted in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Cox models were developed to analyze the effect of breastfeeding as time varying and time dependent factor on birth intervals. Breastfeeding alone improved the log likelihood up to a higher level in each birth interval. Other factors that entered into the models were: at first birth interval, women’s education (high school   above) and working status of women; at second birth interval, survival status of index child alive and husband’s education (high school   above), and at third birth interval, breastfeeding more than 22 month were found to be protective factors for next births. Validation of the developed models was done through bootstrapping to predict birth intervals.
Key words: Cox model, Multivariate analysis, Validation, Predictions.
Resumen
Este estudio utiliza datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud Familiar (International Institute for Population Sciences 1995) realizada en el estado de Tamil Nadu, India. Se desarrollaron modelos de Cox para analizar el efecto de la lactancia materna cuando varía en el tiempo y el factor tiempo depende de los intervalos genésicos. La lactancia materna sólo mejora la probabilidad de acceder a un nivel más alto en cada intervalo de nacimiento. Otros factores que entraron en los modelos fueron en el intervalo del primer parto: nivel educativo de la madre (secundaria y superior) y trabajo de la madre; en el intervalo del segundo parto: nivel de supervivencia en el índice de vida infantil y nivel educativo del padre (secundaria y superior), y en el intervalo del tercer parto: lactancia materna más 22 meses. Cada uno de los anteriores es un factor protector para ampliar el intervalo entre nacimientos en el estudio. Además, este estudio confirma los modelos desarrollados en los servicios públicos de predicción para los intervalos genésicos.
Palabras clave: análisis multivariado, modelo de Cox, predicciones, validación.



1. Introduction
    Population change is a global phenomenon. This varies significantly among
regions and even among countries within the same region. This also varies signif-
icantly among states within the same country. Cognizant of inherent problems in
rapid population growth in developing countries like India, epidemiologists includ-
ing biostatisticians, demographers and social scientists have given high priority
to a thorough understanding of the differentials and determinants of this phe-
nomenon. Rates of population change and various aspects of reproductive health
need to be understood to understand this phenomenon. Birth interval is defined as
interval between termination of one completed pregnancy and the termination of
the next. The intrinsic growth rate as well as the mean generational length of any
population may get affected by the birth interval pattern (Srinivasan 1980). Thus
birth interval can be viewed as a major determinant of population change. The
mechanism of reproductive process can be assessed through the analysis of birth
interval. This is possible because the disaggregating of the reproductive process
is possible into a series of stages, beginning with marriage followed by first birth,
second birth, third birth and so on, provides an insight into the fertility behavior
of the population which is principally responsible for population change. Emphasis
has often been laid on delaying the first birth, interval births, avoiding too many
births, and on stopping child bearing in time (UNFPA 1997). An appropriate epi-
demiological understanding of birth intervals in a region may be helpful to policy
planners for an appropriate public health program for the region in the belief that
such an attempt is likely to provide more accurate results, which would lead to
more appropriate intervention.

Birth Intervals in Tamil Nadu in India                                              291

2. Material and Methods
    The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-I) is a state representative sur-
vey of ever-married women aged 13-49 years. Survey period was from 18th April,
1992 to 7th July, 1992 in Tamil Nadu (TN) (International Institute for Population
Sciences 1995). Data were collected in the form of systematic, stratified sample
of households with two stages in rural areas (selection of villages followed by se-
lection of households) and three stages in urban areas (selection of cities/towns,
followed by urban blocks, and finally households) in self weighting fashion. The
number of households surveyed was 4,287 having 3,948 ever-married women. Out
of them 66.3% were non-sterilized and currently married. The detailed reports cov-
ering sampling methods and all other aspects mentioned above were prepared and
documented in Population Research Centre, The Gandhigram Institute of Rural
Health and Family Welfare Trust, Ambathurai R.S., and International Institute
for Population Sciences (1994).
   The parity (birth order) specific hazards models for birth intervals in TN have
been worked out utilizing available data on 627 women of parity-I, 566 women of
parity-II, and 310 women of parity-III. The results provide information on factors
associated with experiencing next live birth. The order of the interval was the
parity of a woman; e.g., the first birth interval is time interval between effective
age at marriage to first parity of women; the second birth interval is time interval
between first parity and second parity; and so on. In other words (Trussell, Martin,
Fledman, Palmore, Concepcion   Abu Bakar 1985), the order of the interval is the
order of birth that would close the interval; e.g., the first birth interval extends
from the effective age at marriage to the first birth; the second birth interval
extends from the first birth to the second birth; the third birth interval extends
from the second birth to third birth; and so on. Birth intervals were considered in
months as interval variables in the analysis (Trussell et al. 1985).
    Data regarding children from multiple births (including twins) were considered
as single birth and included for the analysis. Further, it was decided to exclude
birth interval during which there was no possibility of conception because the
woman or her husband had been sterilized. As a result of preliminary analysis,
the decision to exclude the higher order birth intervals (fourth onwards) from the
analysis was taken, mainly because of insufficient number of records/events. In-
complete records, almost negligible in number, were not considered in the analysis.
    All the variables in the study satisfied proportional hazard (PH) assumption
except breastfeeding and were considered as fixed covariates with fixed effect. Age
at index child was taken as continuous variable and did not satisfy linear assump-
tion. Age was considered as time varying with fixed effect and age2 was added to
overcome the non-linearity. Breastfeeding was considered as time varying time de-
pendant factor (Dwivedi   Rajvir 2003). As per the method followed by Trussell
et al. (1985), the interval for first birth interval was divided into five categories:
≤ 15 months/16-21 months/22-27 month/28-33 month/≥ 34 months. On account
of lesser proportion of women experiencing next live birth under extreme cate-
gories, the live birth interval related to the second birth interval was divided into
three categories: ≤ 21 months/22-27 months/≥ 28 months. Similarly, live birth

interval under third birth interval was categorized as ≤ 21 months and ≥ 22
months for meaningful analysis. All the variables having (p < 0.25) at univariate
analysis were selected for multivariate Cox analysis and the variables (p < 0.10)
at multivariate analysis were considered in the models.
    Being breastfeeding as time varying covariate with time dependent effect, an
extended Cox hazards model suggested by Trussell et al. (1985) was used. If birth
interval categorized into k categories, general form of the extended Cox Hazards
considered as under:

  λk (t, X(t)) =
                                                                                     
              Xp11           p12
                             X                 p21
                                               X                  p22
                                                                  X
   λ0k t exp      β1i X1i +     β2ik (t)X2i +     β1j X1jk (t) +     β2jk (t)X2jk (t)
              i=1           i=1               j=1                j=1


where, λ0k (t) is category-specific baseline hazard; β1i are respective fixed (time-
independent) effects of fixed covariates X1i ; β2ik (t) are respective category-specific
(time-dependent) effects of fixed covariates X2i ; β1j are respective fixed effects of
time-varying covariates X1jk (t); and β2jk (t) are respective category-specific (time-
dependent) effects of time-varying covariates X2jk (t).
    Maximum likelihood functions for extended Cox model were calculated to pro-
duce estimates of the coefficients and their standard errors (Trussell   Charles
1983). Using regression coefficients and respective standard errors, Risk Ratio or
Hazard Ratio (HR) in the form of exp(β) related to an exposure variable and its
95% confidence interval were calculated and interpreted using standard convention
followed in the case of Cox Proportional Hazard model (Kleinbaum 1996).
    To satisfy the linearity assumption in the Cox PH models, at each time t,
log λ(t) and equivalently log[− log(S(t))] were linearly related to covariates, where
λ(t) was the hazard function or instantaneous event rate at time t and S(t) was
the probability of surviving until time t (not having next birth in the study).
    Log-log survival curves (Cox 1972, Namboodiri   Suchindran 1987, Kleinbaum
1996) were assessed to check PH assumption of proportionality for each fixed
effect with fixed covariate whereas; for continuous covariate i.e. woman’s age,
birth spacing was categorized as ≤ 15 months, 16-21 months, 22-27 months, 28-33
months, and ≥ 34 months, based on an exploratory analysis. For a procedure
involving time dependent variable, presence of breastfeeding for these categories
was specified as > 0, ≥ 16, ≥ 22, ≥ 28 and ≥ 34 months, respectively.
   First order interactions between covariates were tested using stratified analysis
and no interaction was found. Collinearity among the covariates was checked
through correlation analysis (Fox 2008, pp. 307-331).
    All covariates considered in the multivariate analysis were followed by stepwise
method to select variables for inclusion or exclusion from the model in a sequential
fashion. For this, a forward selection with a test for backward elimination was used
with probability levels for entry and removal as 0.15 and 0.10, respectively. This
was done in view of the fact that early deletion of covariates with little chance

of being measured reliably or of being predictive would result in models with less
overfitting and more generalization.
    In order to test validation of developed models, bootstrapping was applied
(Efron   Tibshirani 1993). Calibration curve with 200 re-samples were used to
estimate the optimism between predicted survival probability estimates from the
developed Cox model and the corresponding Kaplan Meier survival probability
(Kaplan   Meier 1958). Shrinkage coefficient was calculated to check for overfit-
ting of the model (Van Houwelingen   Cessie 1990), and discrimination aspect of
the model was measured through Somer’s Dxy rank correlation between predicted
log hazard and observed survival time (Harrell, Lee   Mark 1996, Harrell 2001).
    Predictive probabilities for a woman not attaining next live birth for a partic-
ular variable or combination of variables by holding other variables at their mean
levels were estimated. The exponential expression of the Cox model, also known as
“Risk score” and generally denoted by R, may be defined as follows: R = β1 X1 +
β2 X2 +· · ·+βp Xp (Dickson, Grambsch, Fleming, Fisher   Langworthy 1989, Singh,
Begum, Ahuja, Chandra   Dwivedi 2007), where, X1 , X2 , . . . , Xp are the con-
sidered levels of p predictor variables and β1 , β2 , . . . , βp are respective unknown
regression coefficients.
    Thus, using maximum likelihood estimates of regression coefficients for the
model being used and substituting the observed values of the covariates for each
individual, risk score is obtained for every person (woman) included in the data
analysis. The arithmetic mean of these risk scores provides an average risk score
R1 and hence R1 is constant for a given data set. Risk score R2 is obtained again
by using the equation substituting again the estimated values of the regression
coefficients and changed levels of selected variable/set of variables (same level
for every woman) but retaining other variables at their mean level. S0 (t), the
baseline survival probabilities at different points of time for a person with average
risk score R1 may be worked out using Kaplan Meier method. Thus, S0 (t) at
a given point of time is nothing but the survival probability obtained through
Kaplan Meier method at that point of time. Gain in survival probability after
adjustment in relation to considered levels of selected covariates has been obtained
by S(t) = S0 (t)exp(R2 −R1 ) .
    In the present study, for each model, survival probabilities in relation to R1
are listed under first row of the concerned table, whereas those related to R2 are
listed in successive rows. Thus, differences between these two probabilities provide
gain/loss as a result of proposed change in the levels of selected variable/set of
variables. BMDP 7.0, University of California, 1992; S-Plus 4.0, 1988-97, Math-
soft Inc. Seatle , WA 98109-3044, USA and Excel 2000 Statistical Software were
employed for the analysis.



3. Results
    There is similarity in distribution of women for each birth interval in terms
of religion/caste, place of residence, (ever) contraceptive use, (ever) fetal loss,

sex of index child, survival status of index child, husband’s occupation, type of
house, media exposure, and distance of primary health center (Table 1). As the
parity increased, there was an increase in the proportion of women in categories
characterized by illiteracy, working status of women, illiteracy of husband and
breastfeeding for 22 and more months. Women with high school (and above) edu-
cation were significantly less likely to experience the next live birth in comparison
to illiterate women in case of first and second birth interval, whereas education
was not a significant factor in case of the third birth Interval (HR: 0.79; C.I.:
0.24-2.63). In addition, women with middle education were also significantly less
likely to the experience the next live birth in case of second birth interval (HR:
0.50; C.I.: 0.27-0.92). Ever contraceptive use was a significant protective factor in
case of first and second birth interval in contrast to third birth interval (HR: 0.83;
C.I.: 0.38-1.81). Ever fetal loss was a significant protective factor only in case of
first birth interval (HR: 0.70; C.I.: 0.50-0.97). Previous birth interval was not used
in case of first birth interval. But, women with more than 36 months of previous
birth interval were significantly less likely to experience the next live birth in case
of second birth interval (HR: 0.54; C.I.: 0.33-0.88) but previous birth interval was
not a significant factor for third birth interval (HR: 0.50; C.I.: 0.22-1.10). Further,
women with surviving index child were significantly less likely to experience next
live birth in case of first and second birth interval, but this was not the case for
third birth interval (HR: 0.45; C.I.: 0.16-1.26). Husband’s education (high school
and above) was a significant protective factor against the next live birth only in
the case of second birth interval (HR: 0.41; C.I.: 0.24-0.72). Shorter distance from
primary health center was also a significant protective factor only in the case of
second birth interval (HR: 0.68; C.I.: 0.47-0.99). Surprisingly, breastfeeding did
not emerge as a significant predictor of birth interval in most cases. But, the pe-
riod 1-15 months of breastfeeding did predict the first birth interval where it was
noticed to be a significant risk factor (HR: 1.92; C.I.: 1.04-3.58).

4. Multivariate Analysis
    The final models consisted of varying subsets of variables for first, second, and
third birth intervals. Variables that entered partially are considered fully in the
presentation of final models for a meaningful presentation. In order to account for
age which is a well-known confounder, woman’s age at index child was forced into
the model. Square of woman’s age at index child was also considered in order to
overcome the problem of non-linear relationship.
    The first variable to enter in the model for each birth interval was breastfeeding.
Also, for each birth interval, breastfeeding alone improved the log likelihood up to
a higher level, clearly showed the inclusion of breastfeeding even partially at first
step itself significantly improved the model. High improvement in chi-square with
one degree of freedom was seen for each birth interval, the improvement being
28.3 for first birth interval, 39.9 for second birth interval and 17.7 for third birth
interval. Surprisingly, under the first birth interval, the effect of breastfeeding
persisted only during the period 0-15 months. Also, effect of breastfeeding under
the second birth interval disappeared during each of the periods considered in
the analysis. However, its effect again persisted under the third birth interval
during the period 22 and more months. It may be worth reporting that the role
of breastfeeding fell in line with that reported based on univariate analysis.
    Before comparison of variables entered in the final extended Cox models related
to various birth intervals, it may be noted that subsets of variables considered in
the data analysis vary from first birth interval to third birth interval because vary-
ing periods of classification of breastfeeding were considered. Strictly speaking,
this may prohibit a comparison among the models. However, a qualitative com-
parison of results presented in Tables 2 to 4 reveals that high school (and above)
education of women was a significant protective factor under the first birth interval
analysis (HR: 0.40; C.I.: 0.22-0.75). On the other hand, high school (and above)
education of father (HR: 0.34; C.I.: 0.19-0.61) and survival status of index child
(HR: 0.40; C.I.: 0.22-0.72) were significant protective factors under the second
birth interval analysis. Media exposure entered into the model for the third birth
interval. Ever-fetal loss, survival status of index child, occupation of woman and
husband’s education also entered into the model for the first birth interval. Hence,

variables that entered into the models varied from the first birth interval to the
third birth interval.


5. Validation of the Models
    Calibration curves for extended Cox models for the birth intervals are shown
in Figures 1 to 3. Except for one group with extremely bad prognosis in each
figure, bias corrected calibrations are very good. Shrinkage coefficients related to
first to third birth interval are 0.90, 0.92 and 0.78, respectively (Table 5). This
clearly reveals that 10%, 8% and 22% of the model fitting will be noisy in relation
to first to third birth intervals, respectively. Thus, especially in case of third birth
interval, the shrinkage coefficient could easily be used to shrink predictions to yield
better calibration. Table 5 also shows that the discrimination accuracy in terms of
the calculated Somer’s Dxy rank correlation related to first to third birth interval
are −0.56, −0.62 and −0.68, respectively. This index provides good predictive
accuracy especially in case of third birth interval. In summary, these models are
good enough to describe the parity specific birth intervals in Tamil Nadu.

6. Prediction from the Final Models
    Prediction from the final model may be used to provide important clues to
policy planners through predicted survival probabilities at considered level of a
variable by holding all other variables at their average level in the model. In
the present prediction analysis, the possible selected variables(s) and some com-
bination of variables are: women’s primary education; women’s middle educa-
tion; women’s high school (and above) education; survival of index child; working
women; husband’s education of high school (and above); media exposure; women’s
high school (and above) education and survival index of child; and women’s high
school (and above) education and husband’s high school (and above) education.
On account of varying subsets of variables in the models, only results possible
under each model are presented in the Tables 6 to 8 that deal with first to third
birth intervals.

    There is a decreasing trend in probability of not having next child over a period
of time related to each birth interval. This is more evident in relation to first
birth interval. There is no specific trend with increasing period of breastfeeding.
However, within each category, there is an increasing trend in not having next
child probability in relation to increasing education of women. Women’s high
school (and above) education was noticed to provide maximum benefit. This is in
further evidence if women have a surviving index child.
    Very few predictions were possible in relation to second and third birth intervals
(Tables 7-8). High school (and above) education of husband provided the max-
imum benefits up to the category 22-27 months under the second birth interval.
Similar results were obtained in relation to survival of index child. Surprisingly,
these probabilities were lower during the period of 28 and more months. Under
third birth interval, prediction was possible only in relation to media exposure.

This was not possible under the first and second birth intervals. Interestingly, me-
dia exposure showed maximum benefit during 22 and more months of breastfeeding

7. Discussion

    To our knowledge, there is no study on birth interval, in which an exercise
related to the validity of the developed Cox hazards models has been carried out.
Therefore, there is no scope to compare the developed models in the present study
with those reported under other studies, especially with regard to validity of the
models. However, if necessary, one could examine the reported likelihood values
for models under other studies to provide for a comparison with models developed
in the present study.
    Breastfeeding is the only covariate, which is noticed to be a significant pro-
tective factor associated with each birth interval. Education of women was sig-
nificantly associated with first birth interval only while husband’s education was
significantly associated with first and second birth interval. Survival status of in-
dex child emerged as an important associated factor at second birth interval only
while fetal loss was associated at the first birth interval. However, contraceptive
use did not emerge as a significant associated factor at any birth interval.

    Breastfeeding is the most important and significant factor for extending the
birth interval at all the parities in TN. Trussell et al. (1985) in a study done in the
Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia also found breastfeeding beyond 11 months
to be a significant protective factor on birth interval. Anderson   Bean (1985)
also support the relation between ever breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding
and birth interval. Thus, though the relation between breastfeeding and birth
interval is already documented, this study is able to predict the precise nature of
this effect.
    Education of woman high school (and above) was a protective factor for the first
birth interval. This finding is supported by Rajaram, Rao   Pandey (1994) and
Gandotra, Retherford, Pandey, Luther   Mishra (1998), who found that education
of woman led to reduction in fertility, probably due to increase in awareness and
choice. In contrast, Rodriguez, Hobcraft, McDonald, Menken   Trussell (1984)
found little association between education and birth interval except at higher par-
ities. Ojha (1998) and Richter, Podhisita, Chamratrithirong   Soonthorndhada
(1994) support Rodriguez’s findings. A similar reasoning can be attributed to the
fact that media exposure had a protective impact on higher order birth interval.
This finding is supported by Gandotra et al. (1998).
    This study has clearly indicated that working status of women was a significant
protective factor specifically for the first birth interval in TN. While this is not
supported by Trussell et al. (1985), Richter et al. (1994) noticed that women
employed as salesgirls and manufacturing laborer and in self-employment were
significantly less likely to go for the next birth.
    Ojha (1998) and Blanchard   Bogaert (1997) reported that birth intervals are
comparatively longer following the birth of a male in comparison to female child.
However, sex of index child did not emerge as a significant associated factor. The
present study did not indicate the likelihood of it being a protective factor at any
birth interval.
   Survival of index child emerged as a significant protective factor for the first
and second birth intervals. This was in line with many other studies like Oheneba-
Sakyi   Heaton (1993); Rehman   DaVanzo (1993) Rajaram et al. (1994); Ojha
(1998); and Palloni   Hantamala (1999). This shows that this factor is not a
country or region specific determinant.
    Other documented factors such as contraceptive use (Rajaram et al. 1994, Mah-
mud   Islam 1995), place of residence (Swenson   Thang 1993) and importance
of previous birth interval in extending succeeding birth intervals (Rodriguez et al.
1984, DaVanzo   Starbird 1991, Miller, Trussell, Pabley   Vaughan 1992, Swenson
& Thang 1993, Trussell et al. 1985) were not supported in this study.


8. Limitations
    First National Health and Family Survey (NFHS) was conducted in 1992-93
in India and data was available to use in 1995. However, no study is available till
now on breastfeeding as a time varying covariate with time dependent effect using

bootstrap technique for validations and predictions. These techniques have been
used for the first time on birth interval data. Our internet search has not revealed
any similar study. Therefore, we felt that the study has valuable information for
strategic and policy planners and gives more occasion for readership.


9. Conclusion
    This study showed that subsets of important covariates, which entered into
the final models, varied among the birth intervals within the state. However, the
assessment of predictive accuracy clearly established the suitability of the parity
specific developed models in describing respective birth interval. Thus, the present
study emphasizes the need for regional studies in planning public health programs
as per needs of the region. Further, this study also demonstrates the importance
of parity specific analysis of birth interval and may assist in working out parity
specific strategies in the considered region. Breastfeeding emerged as an important
protective covariate that extended the birth interval irrespective of parity. Further,
education of women, sex of index child, husband’s education, and media exposure
also demonstrated an important protective role for extending birth interval in the
study.
