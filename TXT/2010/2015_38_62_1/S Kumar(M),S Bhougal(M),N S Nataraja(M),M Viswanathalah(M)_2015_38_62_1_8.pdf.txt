Abstract
Under classical survey sampling theory the errors mainly studied in the estimation are sampling errors. However, often non-sampling errors are more influential to the properties of the estimator than sampling errors. This is recognized by practitioners, researchers and many great works of literature regarding non-sampling errors have been published during last two decades, especially regarding non-response error which is one of the cornerstones of the non-sampling errors. The literature handles one kind of non-sampling error at a time, although in real surveys more than one non-sampling error is usually present.In this paper, two kinds of non-sampling errors are considered at the estimation stage: non-response and measurement error. An exponential ratio type estimator has been developed to estimate the population mean of the response variable in the presence of non-response and measurement errors. Theoretically and empirically, it has been shown that the proposed estimator is more efficient than usual unbiased estimator and other existing estimators.

Resumen
En la teoría de muestreo de la encuesta clásica los errores estudiados principalmente en la estimación son el muestreo errores. Sin embargo, a menudo los errores ajenos al muestreo son más influyentes que las propiedades del estimador de errores de muestreo. Esto es reconocido por los profesionales, los investigadores y muchos grandes obras de la literatura en relación con los errores ajenos al muestreo se ha publicado en los últimos dos decenios, especialmente en relación con el error de falta de respuesta, que es una de las piedras angulares de los errores ajenos al muestreo. La literatura se ocupa de un tipo de error no muestral a la vez, aunque en las encuestas reales más de un error no muestral suele estar presente. En este trabajo, dos tipos de errores ajenos al muestreo son considerados en la etapa de la estimación: la falta de respuesta y el error de medición. Un tipo exponencial estimador de razón ha sido desarrollado para estimar la media poblacional de la variable de respuesta en presencia de errores de falta de respuesta y de medición. Teóricamente y empíricamente, se ha mostrado que el estimador propuesto es más eficiente que estimador insesgado habitual y otros estimadores existentes.
Palabras clave: error cuadrático medio, error de medición, error de muestreo, estimación, estimador de razón.



1. Introduction
    Design based estimation methods use the sampling distribution that results
when the values for the finite population units are considered to be fixed, and the
variation of the estimates arises from the fact that statistics are based on a random
sample drawn from the population rather than a census of the entire population,
(see, Kish 1954, Sarndal, Swensson & Wretman 1992, Kish 1994, Gregoire 1998,
Koch & Gillings 2006, Binder 2008, Dorazio 1999, Shabbir, Haq & Gupta 2014).
    The results of a survey are used to make quantitative statements about the
population studied i.e. descriptive statements about the aggregate population
analytic statements about the relationship among subgroups of the population,
or interpretive statements about the nature of social or economic processes. A
survey error occurs when there is discrepancy between the statements and reality.
These errors are of two types sampling and non-sampling errors. Sampling errors
comprise the differences between the sample and the population due solely to the
particular units that happen to have been selected. Non sampling errors encompass
all other things that contribute to survey error. Non sampling errors are said to
arise from wrongly conceived definitions, imperfections in the tabulation plans,
failure to obtain response from all sample members, and so on. (see, Ilves 2011,
Groves 1989).
    In practice the researcher faces the problem of measurement error while collect-
ing information from individuals. Measurement error is the difference between the
value that is recorded and the true value of a variable in the study. For example,
in surveys regarding household consumption/expenditure where the respondents
are asked to report their consumption/expenditure catalog, there is a great like-
lihood that the respondents may fail to recall precisely how much they spent on
various items over the interval. Many researchers have studied measurement errors
like Cochran (1963), Cochran (1977), Fuller (1995), Shalabh (1997), Manisha &
Singh (2001), Manisha & Singh (2002), Wang (2002), Allen, Singh & Smarandache

& Karpe (2010), (Gregoire & Salas 2009, Salas & Gregoire 2010), Shukla, Pathak
& Thakur (2012), and Sharma & Singh (2013), etc.
    Another problem the researcher faces is due to non-response which refers to the
failure to collect information from one or more respondents on one or more vari-
ables. The reasons non-response occurs include non-availability of the respondents
at home, refusal to answer the questionnaire, lack of information, etc. Hansen &
Hurwitz (1946) considered the problem of non-response while estimating the pop-
ulation mean by taking a sub sample from the non-respondent group with the
help of extra efforts and an estimator was proposed by combining the information
available from the response and non-response groups. In estimating population
parameters like the mean, total or ratio, sample survey experts sometimes use
auxiliary information to estimate improve precision. When the population mean
of the auxiliary variable X is known and in presence of non-response, the problem
of estimating the population mean of the study variable Y has been discussed by
Cochran (1977), Rao (1986), Khare & Srivastava (1997), Kumar, Singh, Bhougal
& Gupta (2011), Singh & Kumar (2008). In Hansen & Hurwitz (1946) method,
questionnaires are mailed to all the respondents included in a sample and a list
of non-respondents is prepared after the deadline is over. Then a sub sample is
drawn from the set of non-respondents and a direct interview is conducted with
the selected respondents and the necessary information is collected.
    Researchers who have studied non-response have ignored the presence of pos-
sible measurement errors and researchers who have studied measurement errors
have neglected non-response. In practice, it is possible for a researcher to face
the problem of measurement error and non-response at the same time. Jackman
(1999) dealt with both non-response and measurement error simultaneously, in
the case of voter turnout, where a reasonably large body of vote validation studies
supply auxiliary information, allowing the components of bias in survey estimates
of turnout rates to be isolated. Averaging over the auxiliary information provides
bounds on the quantity of interest, yielding an estimate corrected for both non-
response and measurement error. Further, Dixon (2010) studied the estimation
of non-response bias and measurement error on the data from Consumer Expen-
diture Quarterly Interview Survey (CEQ), Current Population Survey (CPS) and
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an attempt to measure the differences
in employment status of Washington.
    In this paper, we have developed new estimators for estimating the population
mean of the variable of interest when there is measurement error and non-response
error in the study as well as in the auxiliary variable. An empirical study is
carried out to show the efficiency of our suggested estimators over some available
estimators.

2. Sampling Procedure and Some Well Defined
   Estimators
    A simple random sample of size n is selected from the population of size N
by a simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) method. Let

                                          auxiliary variable, respectively.

                                                                        PN Let µY = 2
N    i=1 y i ,µX = N  i=1  x i , σ y =  N   i=1 (yi − µY )  and σ x = N   i=1 (xi − µX )
denote the population mean and the population variance of the study variable y
and auxiliary variables x.
   Let (xi , yi ) be the observed values and (Xi , Yi ) be the true values of two
characteristics (x, y) respectively associated with the ith (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) sample
unit. Let the measurement errors be

                                     Ui = yi − Yi ,

and
                                     Vi = xi − Xi .

    Measurement errors are assumed to be random in nature and they are uncor-
                                        2
related with mean zero and variances σU    and σV2 respectively. Let σX  2
                                                                            and σY2
denote the variances of the auxiliary variable X and the variable of interest Y
respectively for the population, Cy and Cx be the coefficient of variations of vari-
able Y and X respectively for the population, and let ρyx be the coefficient of
correlation between the variable Y and X for the population. We further assume
that the measurement errors for variable Y and X are independent.
    If there is some non-response, (Hansen & Hurwitz 1946) proposed a double
sampling scheme for estimating population a mean, simple random sample of size
n is selected and the questionnaire is mailed to the sampled units; the number of
respondents in the sample is denoted by n1 and the number of the non-respondents
in the sample is denoted by n2 and a sub-sample of size r (r = n2 /k; k > 1)
is taken from non-respondents in the sample, where k is the inverse sampling
ratio. Let (x∗i , yi∗ ) be the observed values and (Xi∗ , Yi∗ ) be the true values of two
characteristics (x,y) respectively associated with the ith (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) sample
unit. Let the measurement error associated with the study variable be

                                    u∗i = yi∗ − Yi∗ .

    If there is complete response on the auxiliary variable, let the measurement
error associated with the auxiliary variable be

                                     vi = xi − Xi .

    If there is some non-response on the auxiliary variable, let the measurement
error associated with the auxiliary variable be

                                    vi∗ = x∗i − Xi∗ .

                                                2
for non-respondents of the population. Let σX(2)    and σY2 (2) be the variances for
variables X and Y respectively for population non-respondents and ρyx(2) be the
coefficient of correlation between the variable X and Y for non-respondents of the
population. Let Cx(2) and Cy(2) be the coefficient of variations for variables X and
Y respectively for the non-respondents in the population. It is further assumed
that the measurement errors for variables X and Y are independent.

is the contribution of measurement error to the mean square error of t5 .
In the present study, we have proposed exponential ratio type estimator in the
situation where non-response and measurement errors are present in both study
variable and auxiliary variable.


3. The Suggested Estimator
   Non sampling errors are present in both sample surveys and censuses, and
can occur at any stage of the survey process. There are many potential sources of

non-sampling error, for example, businesses not responding to a survey, processing
errors, or respondents unintentionally reporting incorrect values. The greater the
impact these sources of error, the greater the difference will be between our survey
(or census) estimate and the true value. The following is the proposed estimator
when there is non-response and measurement error in both study and auxiliary
variable
                                ∗
                                      b∗δ

For α = 0, the proposed estimator t becomes equal to estimator t5 .
    To obtain the expressions of mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed esti-

5. Empirical Study
    In this section, we demonstrate the performance of different estimators over the
usual unbiased estimators, generating four populations from normal distribution
with different choices of parameters by using R language program. The auxiliary
information on variable X has been generated from N (5, 10) population. This type
of population is very relevant in most socio-economic situations with one interest
and one auxiliary variable.

   From Table 5; it is envisaged that the proposed estimator at its optimum
performs more efficiently than the usual unbiased estimator, Shalabh’s (t1 ) and
Shukla et al. (t2 ) estimators for estimating the population mean in the presence
of measurement error.

6. Conclusion

     An important goal is understanding, managing, controlling, and reporting all
known sources of error having impact on the quality of our statistics. In the present
study, we have proposed an estimator for estimating the population mean of the
study variable. The suggested estimator uses auxiliary information to improve
efficiencies in situations where there are non-response and measurement errors
concerning study variable and auxiliary variable. The relative performance of the
proposed estimators is compared with conventional estimators. The proposed es-
timator performs better than the usual unbiased estimator t0 , Shalabh’s (1997)
(t1 ) and Shukla, Pathak & Thakue (2012) (t2 ) estimators in the presence of mea-
surement error; and its performance is better than the usual unbiased estimator
b∗y and estimator t5 in the presence of measurement error and non-response. The
µ
study is supported by empirical study based on four populations.
    We recommend our proposed estimator for future assess to study the charac-
teristics of the variable in interest where measurement errors and non-response
occur in the survey.
