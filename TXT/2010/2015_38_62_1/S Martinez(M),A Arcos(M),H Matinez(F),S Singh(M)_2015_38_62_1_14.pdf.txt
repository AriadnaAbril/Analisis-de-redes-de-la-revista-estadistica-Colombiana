Abstract
This paper considers the problem of estimating the population proportion of a categorical variable using the calibration framework. Different situations are explored according to the level of auxiliary information available and the theoretical properties are investigated. A new class of estimator based upon the proposed calibration estimators is also defined, and the optimal estimator in the class, in the sense of minimal variance, is derived. Finally, an estimator of the population proportion, under new calibration conditions, is defined. Simulation studies are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed calibration estimators via the empirical relative bias and the empirical relative efficiency, and favourable results are achieved.

1. Introduction

    In the presence of auxiliary information, various approaches may be used to im-
prove the precision of estimators at the estimation stage. The book of Singh (2003)
contains several examples, including ratio, difference or calibration estimators, fol-
lowing the methodology proposed by Deville & Särndal (1992) and Särndal (2007),
or regression estimators, as the papers of Arnab, Shangodoyin & Singh (2010) and
Singh, Singh & Kozak (2008) show. These techniques are generally more efficient
than other methods not using auxiliary information. Usually social surveys are
focused on categorical variables as sex, race, potential voters, etc.
    Efficient insertion of available auxiliary information would improve the preci-
sion the estimations for the proportion of a categorical variable of interest. Con-
ceptually, it is difficult to justify using a regression estimator for estimating pro-
portions. Duchesne (2003) considered estimators of a proportion under different
sampling schemes and presented an estimator which used the logistic regression
estimator. The model calibration technique proposed by Wu & Sitter (2001) can
be also used to estimate a proportion by using a logistic regression model. Based
on logistic models, these estimators efficiently facilitate good modeling of survey
data assuming that unit-specific auxiliary data in the population U are available.
In this case it is assumed that the values of auxiliary variables are known for the
entire finite population (referred to as complete auxiliary information) but the
values of main variable are known only if the unit is selected in the sample.
    It is very common for population data associated with auxiliary variables to
be obtained from census results, administrative files, etc., and these sources often
provide different parameters for these auxiliary variables. For example, position
measures (mean, median and other moments) are normally provided, but there
is no access to data for each individual. In the present study, it is assumed that
the only datum known is the proportion of individuals presenting one or more
characteristics related to the study variable.
     Under this assumption, Rueda, Muñoz, Arcos, Álvarez & Martínez (2011) de-
fined an estimator and various confidence intervals for a proportion using the ratio
method. The results of their simulation studies show that ratio estimators are more
efficient than traditional estimators. Confidence intervals outperform alternative
methods, especially in terms of interval width.

Estimating Proportions by Calibration Estimators                                   269

    Calibration techniques were first employed by Deville & Särndal (1992) to
estimate the total population, but this approach is also applicable to the esti-
mation more complex of parameters than the total population. Relevant papers
estimating population variances are Singh (2001), Singh, Horn, Chowdhury & Yu
(1999) and Farrell & Singh (2005). The estimation of finite population distribution
functions is studied in papers by Harms & Duchesne (2006) or Rueda, Martínez,
Martínez & Arcos (2007) and the estimation of quantiles in Rueda, Martínez-
Puertas, Martínez-Puertas & Arcos (2007). In Section 2 we review a proportion
estimator using the calibration technique. Section 3 describes alternative methods
for deriving the calibration estimator for the proposed parameter. In Section 4 we
extend these methods to the multiple case. A simulation study is performed in
Section 5 and our conclusions are reported in Section 7.


2. Calibration Estimators for the Proportion
2.1. Definition of the Calibration Estimator
    Assume a sample s with size n from a finite population U = {1, 2, . . . , N }
with size N , selected by a specific sampling design d, with inclusion probabilities
πk and πkl assumed to be strictly positive. Let A be an attribute of study in
the population U , defining Ak = 1 when a unit k of the population U has the
attribute A and Ak = 0 otherwise. The population proportion of attribute A in
the population U is given by:

                                        1 X
                                 PA =       Ak .                                   (1)
                                        N
                                           k∈U

To estimate (1), the usual design-weighted Horvitz-Thompson estimator is:

                                       1   X
                                PbAH =           dk Ak                             (2)
                                       N
                                           k∈s

where dk = 1/πk .
    If we consider an auxiliary attribute B in which the value Bk is known for every
unit k in the sample s and PB is also known, the above estimator cannot incor-
porate the information provided by the attribute B, in estimating the population
proportion of A. One way of incorporating auxiliary information in the parameter
estimation is via replacing the weights dk by new weights ωk , using calibration
techniques.
   Calibration is a highly desirable property for survey weights, as Särndal (2007)
argues, for the following reasons:

   • it provides a systematic way of taking auxiliary information into account;

   • it is a means of obtaining consistent estimates, with known aggregates;


                                    Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 267–293

   • it is used by statistical agencies for estimating different finite population
     parameters. Several national statistical agencies have developed software
     designed to compute calibration weights based on auxiliary information avail-
     able in population registers and other sources. Such agencies include CLAN
     (Statistics Sweden) and BASCULA (Central Bureau of Statistics, The Nether-
     lands).

    Following Deville & Särndal (1992) to obtain a calibration estimator for the
attribute A based on the attribute B, we calculate the weights ωk minimizing the
chi-square distance
                                    X (ωk − dk )2
                               χ2 =                                          (3)
                                          dk qk
                                      k∈s
subject to the condition
                                  1 X      1 X
                           PB =       Bk =     ωk Bk                                 (4)
                                  N        N
                                     k∈U            k∈s

where qk are known positive constants unrelated to dk and 0 < PB < 1.

      By minimizing (3) under (4), the new weights ωk are given by:
                                         λdk qk Bk
                                  ωk = dk +                                          (5)
                                             N
where λ is the following Lagrange multiplier
                                     N 2 (PB − PbBH )
                                λ=     X
                                           dk qk Bk
                                        k∈s

and PbBH is the usual Horvitz-Thompson estimator for the attribute B.
                                              X
   With the calibration weights (5), assuming   dk qk Bk 6= 0, the resulting esti-
                                                    k∈s
mator is:
                    1   X                  (PB − PbBH ) X
             PbAW =         ωk Ak = PbAH + X            ·   dk qk Bk Ak              (6)
                    N                          dk qk Bk k∈s
                        k∈s
                                              k∈s

By (4), when the estimator is applied to estimate the population proportion of B,
it coincides with PB .


2.2. Properties of the Calibration Estimator
   Following Deville & Särndal (1992), it can be shown that the estimator PbAW is
an asymptotically unbiased estimator for PA and its asymptotic variance is given
by
                                  1 XX
                   AV (PbAW ) = 2            ∆kl (dk Ek )(dl El )             (7)
                                 N
                                        k∈U l∈U

                                                                    qk Bk Ak
                                                              k∈U
where ∆kl = πkl − πk πl ; Ek = Ak − D · Bk and D =             X
                                                                     qk Bk
                                                               k∈U

   An estimator for this variance is
                                   X X ∆kl
                      Vb (PbAW ) =         (dk ek )(dl el )                             (8)
                                       πkl
                                         k∈U l∈U
                                       X
                                 dk qk Bk Ak
                             k∈s

                                  dk qk Bk

Example 1. Under SRSWOR and qk = 1 for all k ∈ U the estimator PbAW is:
                                                          pbAB
                               PbAW = pbA + (PB − pbB ) ·
                                                            pbB
   where
                     1X                  1X                           1X
             pbA =      Ak ;     pbB =      Bk         and   pbAB =      Ak Bk

3. Alternative Calibration Estimators
   The usual estimator under SRSWOR, pbA has the following shift invariance
property
                               pbA = 1 − qbA                           (11)


                                         Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 267–293

272                 Sergio Martínez, Antonio Arcos, Helena Martínez & Sarjinder Singh


     Hence pbA has the same performance in the estimation of PA as the performance
of qbA in the estimation of QA . In general, this property is not satisfied by PbAW .
It is easy to see that this property is fulfilled if
                                             1 X
                                      1=         ωk                                  (12)
                                             N
                                               k∈s

Thus, we have two ways of obtaining an estimator with the above property:
                                                b AW for QA based on QB , and deter-
     (i) By considering a calibration estimator Q
         mining when the estimator PAW has a smaller variance than the estimator
                                      b
         Q
         b AW in order to define a new estimator based on these two.

 (ii) By considering a calibration estimator for PA based on PB and QB because
      if we derive a calibration estimator that provides perfect estimates for PB
      and QB , then:

                                1 X         1 X                1 X
               1 = PB + QB =        ωk Bk +     ωk (1 − Bk ) =     ωk
                                N           N                  N
                                     k∈s              k∈s                  k∈s



3.1. An Estimator Based on the Complementary: The PbAT
     Estimator
      The first alternative is developed only under SRSWOR, minimizing (3) subject
to
                                              1 X
                          QB = 1 − PB =           ωk (1 − Bk )                       (13)
                                              N
                                                k∈U

The resulting estimator, assuming qbB 6= 0, can be expressed by

                            b AW = qbA + (QB − qbB ) · qbAB
                            Q                                                        (14)

   Let us now compare the asymptotic variance of PbAW with the following esti-
mator of PA , PbAQ = 1 − qbAB . We have (see Appendix A) AV (PbAW ) < AV (PbAQ )
when
                                  PAB     QAB
                                       <       .                            (17)
                                   PB      QB
   Hence, asymptotically, a more efficient estimator for the population proportion
PA is
                                         pbAB    qbAB
                          Pb           if       <       or qbB = 0
                       AW

                       PbAQ           if       ≥       or pbB = 0

                                            pbB     qbB
Note that the asymptotic variance of PbAT is

                                                               PAB   QAB

                            


   To estimate the asymptotic variance of PbAT the estimator can be defined by
(10) when the following condition is satisfied

                               pbAB    qbAB
                                     <              or qbB = 0                         (19)
                                 pbB     qbB

and it can be defined by (16) if

                               pbAB    qbAB
                                     ≥             or pbB = 0.                         (20)
                                 pbB     qbB

   When in condition (20) the equality is satisfied, we have PbAW = PbAQ , which
implies that AV (PbAW ) = AV (PbAQ ) and Vb (PbAW ) = Vb (PbAQ ).
   The reason for defining PbAT is to obtain an estimator with the property PbAT =
1−Q b AT . Accordingly, the estimator Qb AT is defined by
                                                   qbAB    pbAB

                 b AW when qbAB = pbAB , we have 1 − Q
Since PbAW = 1 − Q                                   b AT = PbAT .
                             qbB    pbB

    Another important question relative to the estimator PbAT is: for low pro-
portions, estimators such as PbAW cannot be calculated when pbB = 0. The es-
timator PbAT does not present this problem, because if pbB = 0 the estimator
PbAT = 1 − Qb AW and since qbB = 1 we have

                                 b AW = 1 − qbA + (QB − qbB ) · qbAB
                      PbAT = 1 − Q

Then the estimator PbAT can be obtained for low proportions.

    Finally, the estimator PbAT has the following drawback: by (9); (15) and (18),
its asymptotic behaviour is worse than that of the usual estimator when

                             PAB − PA PB = QAB − QA QB < 0                              (21)

Thus, if condition (21) occurs, we propose to use the attribute B̄ = B c because

                                       1 X
                   PAB̄ − PA PB̄ =         Ak (1 − Bk ) − PA (1 − PB ) =
                                       N
                                         k∈U

                    = PA − PAB − PA + PA PB = −PAB + PA PB > 0
Therefore, with attribute B̄, the above problem, when (21) occurs, is solved.


3.2. An Optimal Estimator: The PbAα Estimator
      Another way to improve the asymptotic behaviour is as follows: let us define

                             PbAα = α · PbAW + (1 − α)(1 − Q
                                                           b AW )                       (22)
and take the value α that minimizes the variance.
   The minimum variance of PbAα is given by (see Appendix B)

                                                            φ2
                                                                  
                             AV (PbAα ) = G · PA QA −
                                                           PB QB
      with
                                  
                  1−f        N
             G=                        and     φ = PAB − PA PB = QAB − QA QB
                   n        N −1

Estimating Proportions by Calibration Estimators                                   275

   and this is achieved where
                   (PAB − PA PB ) − PB QAB      P   − PB
              α=                        =     AB        .                     (23)
                            PAB    QAB          PAB    QAB
                    PB QB        −          PB      −
                            PB      QB           PB    QB

   The estimator PbAα has the desirable property

                                  PbAα = 1 − Q
                                             b Aα

because if we define
                                  b AW + (1 − β)(1 − PbAW )
                       b Aα = β · Q
                       Q

then
     b Aα = (1 − β) · PbAW + β · (1 − Q
   1−Q                                b AW ) = α · PbAW + (1 − α)(1 − Q
                                                                      b AW )

with α = 1 − β. Since AV (1 − Q b Aα ) = AV (Qb Aα ), we find that minimizing the
variance of QAα with respect to β is equal to minimizing the variance 1 − Q
            b                                                                b Aα
with respect to α, and consequently α is again given by (44) and PAα = 1 − QAα .
                                                                  b         b

   The PbAα estimator presents the following disadvantages:

   • It cannot be calculated if pbB = 0 or qbB = 0
   • The optimum value α given by (44) depends on theoretical variances and
     covariances, which are generally unknown.

With respect to the second question, the value α can be easily estimated when the
sample is drawn by
                                       pb − pbB
                            α̃ =       AB            
                                        pbAB    qbAB
                                  pbB         −
                                          pbB     qbB
Therefore, we obtain the following estimator

                        P̃Aα = α̃PbAW + (1 − α̃)(1 − Q
                                                     b AW )

The estimator P̃Aα also has the desired property (11).


3.3. An estimator that Calibrate in PB and QB at the Same
     Time: The PbAR Estimator
    When using the population size and the population proportion of B, the aux-
iliary information is the same as in the case of a post-stratified estimator. The
second way (ii) to obtain the property (11), based on an estimator for PA cali-
bration with PB and QB , can be developed in any sampling design. To do so, we
must minimize the distance (3) under the conditions

the estimator (26) cannot be obtained. This problem is solved as follows: since
the two conditions are mutually exclusive, if
                                X
                                    dk qk Bk = 0

we can calibrate the estimator using only the attribute B̄. On the other hand, if
                              X
                                  dk qk (1 − Bk ) = 0
                                   k∈s


the estimator PbAR can be developed only with the attribute B. Thus, the estima-
tor PbAR is well defined.

   To prevent this article from becoming excessively long, in the same way as with
the estimator PbAW , the asymptotic variance of (26) is given by

PbAR is (see Appendix C).

   To estimate (45) the following estimator is defined
                                            "                   #

with φb = pbAB − pbA pbB .

   Thus, the estimator PbAR has the same asymptotic variance as the estimator
PbAα . Then, by (45), under SRSWOR the estimator PbAR is always more efficient
than the estimators pbA and PbAT .

    Note that the proposed estimator is essentially a post-stratified estimator and,
in this sense, is not new. Here, we look at it from a different point of view.
In a practical situation, the estimator PbAR is preferred the estimator PbAα , since
PbAR does not need estimation of any unknown population quantity. The case of
estimator PbAα requires estimating value α, which is generally unknown.

4. Extension to Multivariate Auxiliary Information
   The previous section considered only an auxiliary attribute B; let us now as-
sume that the study attribute A is related to J auxiliary attributes B1 , . . . BJ .
    To develop the usual way of incorporating the information provided by J at-
tributes in the estimation of PbA with calibration techniques, we consider a new
weight ωk subject to the following conditions

                             1 X       1 X
                  Pj =           Bjk =     ωk Bjk                    j = 1, . . . , J.     (33)

Next, we denote
      0                              0                                          0
   P = (P1 , . . . , PJ ); (PbH ) = (Pb1H , . . . , PbJH ) and (Bk ) = (B1k , . . . , BJk )

where

                                          k∈s

By T we denote the following matrix
                                X
                            T =     dk qk Bk (Bk )0 .
                                            k∈s


   With the minimization of (3) under the P conditions given by (33), the new
weights obtained are:
                                                                0

The calibration estimator based on (34) is given by:
                                                         0
                                PbAW M = PbAH + (P − PH ) Hb                               (35)

     b = T −1
with H                dk qk Bk Ak .
                k∈s

  Note that the weights (34) and the estimator PbAW M cannot be obtained if the
matrix T is singular.

  Following Rueda et al. (2007a), the asymptotic variance of the estimator
PAW M is

5. Simulation study
    A limited study was carried out to investigate the design-based finite sample
performance of the proposed estimators in comparison with that of conventional
estimators.


5.1. Simulated data
    The estimators were evaluated using 15 simulated populations with a popu-
lation size N = 1000. These populations were generated as a random sample of
1000 units from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter PA = {0.5, 0.75, 0.9}, and
the attributes of interest were thus achieved with the aforementioned population
proportions. Auxiliary attributes were also generated, using the same distribu-
tion, but a given proportion of values were randomly changed so that Cramer’s V
coefficient between the attribute of interest and the auxiliary attribute took the
values 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9.
    For each simulation, 1000 samples with sizes n= 50, 75, 100 and 125, were
selected under SRSWOR to compare the estimators:

 (1) the Horvitz-Thompson estimator PbAH

 (2) the ratio estimator PbAratio (see Rueda et al., 2011),

 (3) PbAW estimator (W-calibrated),

 (4) PbAT estimator (T-calibrated),

 (5) P̃Aα estimator with α estimated (α-calibrated),

 (6) PbAR estimator (R-calibrated),

 (7) the multivariate ratio estimator PbAratioM (see Rueda et al., 2011) (Multiple
     ratio), and

 (8) the multivariate calibration estimator PbAW M (Multiple calibrated).

                         E[e                        M SE[e pA ]
                  RB =                ,     RE =                   ,
                             PA                    M SE[PbAratio ]

peA is a given estimator and E[·] and M SE[·] denote, respectively, the empirical
mean and the mean square error. Values of RE less than 1 indicate that peA is
more efficient than PbAratio .
   The results derived from this simulation study gave values of RB within a
reasonable range. All the calibration estimators produced absolute relative bias
values of less than 1% except in case PA =0.9 and φ=0.9. Univariate ratio estimator
produced the highest bias values, especially for small sample sizes.
   Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the values of RE for the various populations.
   These figures show:

   • The ratio estimator performs poorly when there is little association between
     the variables. When φ = 0.5 this estimator is worse than the Horvitz-
     Thompson estimator. Even when φ = 0.6 as is sometimes the case (PA =
     0.75 and PA = 0.9) the ratio estimator has a large MSE. In populations with
     a large φ this problem does not arise.

   • With large φ values, all the estimators that use auxiliary information produce
     good results: for φ ≥ 0.7 all calibration and ratio estimators are better than
     the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. It is also seen that as φ increases, all the
     estimators achieve greater precision, which is particularly marked for very
     high proportions.

   • Of all the calibration estimators, the first one proposed PbAW has the lowest
     degree of efficiency. Although it performs better than the Horvitz-Thompson
     estimator on most occasions (except when PA =0.9, φ=0.5 and 0.6) the others
     produce a smaller MSE.

   • The PbAT , P̃Aα and PbAR estimators perform very well in all cases. For high
     proportions (PA =0.75 and 0.9) the efficiency of the estimators is fairly sim-
     ilar; only in the case of PA =0.5 and small values of φ is there a noticeable
     difference between them, in terms of efficiency. In these cases, the best re-
     sults are achieved by the PbAR estimators that calibrate in PB and QB at the
     same time.

Figure 1: Empirical relative efficiency (RE) of the different estimators for the simulated

   • The sample size does not produce a clear effect on the behaviour of the
     estimators; in some cases, as the sample size increases, the efficiency of the
     estimators increases, while in others, it decreases (as when φ = 0.9 and
     PA =0.9).
   • Ratio and calibration estimators using two auxiliary variables always have
     a lower RE than those using a single auxiliary variable. For PA =0.5 and
     0.5 ≤ φ ≤ 0.7 the multiple calibration estimator is slightly more efficient
     than the multiple ratio estimator. For PA =0.75 and 0.9 both estimators
     have similar levels of efficiency.

    Ratio estimation is usually known to work well when the variables (auxiliary
and of interest) are positively correlated. In this case it is applied to 0-1 variables,
so that a positive association is expected for the method to work (higher frequen-

cies for the A=1; B=1 (A=0; B=0) cases instead of the 0;1 (1;0) cases). From
this study we can conclude that the association between the variables is the most
important factor influencing the behaviour of ratio and also of calibration estima-
tors. As expected, as φ increases the M SE of the calibrated estimators decreases.
Even for moderate values of φ the calibration estimators improve considerably, in
terms of efficiency, on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. The behaviour of cali-
bration estimators is similar for small proportions, whereas when the proportion
approaches 1 there are larger differences among the proposed calibration estima-
tors. Hovewer, it is not an easy task to quantify how much association is needed
for a good improvement in terms of efficiency, or when too small that it becomes
harmful to introduce extra variables in the calibration constraints.

5.2. Real Data

   In this section we apply some proposed estimators to data obtained in a survey
on perceptions of immigration in a certain region in Spain. A sample of size
n = 1919 was selected from a population with size N = 4982920, using stratified
random sampling.
   Among topics of interest in the survey was estimating the percentage of citi-
zens who believe that the authorities should make immigration more difficult by
imposing stricter conditions. The auxiliary variable available is the respondent’s
gender. This variable was observed in the sample and the totals are known for
each province (stratum).


                                                                     Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 267–293

Estimating Proportions by Calibration Estimators                                   285

    Three main variables are included in this study, related to “goodness of immi-
gration” and “amount of immigration”. The main variables are the answers to the
following questions:

   • in general, do you think that for Andalusia, immigration is . . . ? c1-Very
     bad, c2 Bad, c3 Neither good nor bad, c4 Good, c5 Very good,

   • and in relation to the number of immigrants currently living in Andalusia,
     do you think there are . . . ? c1-Too many, c2-A reasonable number,
     c3-Too few.

    In this simulation study, we use the sample as population and we draw strati-
fied random samples of size n = 240 with proportional allocation (eight stratum).
Relative efficiency with respect to the ratio estimator is computed, as in the pre-
vious case, for compared estimators over 1000 simulation runs. We computed this
relative efficiency for each category of the main variable (5 categories in the first
case, and 3 in the second case) and the average over categories is also computed.
At the same time, confidence intervals based on a normal distribution and using
proposed estimated variances are computed for each proportion. Table 1 shows the
average length of the 1000 simulation runs for each category and the average over
categories. In a similar way, the empirical coverage of the confidence estimation
is computed.
    Tables 1 and 2 show that, from an efficiency standpoint PbAα is best. Looking
the average length of confidence intervals for the proportion in each category, and
the average over categories, the best estimator is PbAR , but the optimal PbAα has
very similar results. However, the empirical coverage of confidence intervals is
closer to the nominal level when the optimal estimator is used.



6. Application
    IESA, the Institute for Advanced Social Studies conducted a survey between
January 14th and February 13th, 2011 on the perception of culture in the Spanish
region of Andalusia (Barometer of Culture of Andalusia - BACU). It is based on
a sample drawn from a landline phone frame (N = 5,064,304).
    From this frame a stratified random sample without replacement of dimen-
sion n = 641 was selected, where strata were made up by eight geographical
regions. Strata population sizes are Nh = (274128, 919124, 463008, 502450,
237183, 441936, 856392, 1370083) and the corresponding strata sample sizes are
nh = (53, 99, 66, 62, 38, 49, 131, 143).
    Among several topics of interest in the survey, is the interest to estimate per-
ception of their culture in relation to European citizens. An auxiliary variable
available is gender which totals are known for each strata. From Table 3 we ob-
serve that the PbAα estimator produces the best confidence intervals.

7. Conclusions

    In practice, it is important to make the best possible use of available auxiliary
information so as to obtain the most efficient estimator possible.
    When a proportion can be estimated in the case of complete auxiliary informa-
tion (i.e., when auxiliary information is available at the population level for each
unit) it is possible to consider estimators that use the logistic regression model
(Duchesne, 2003, Wu and Sitter, 2001), as an improvement on the simple esti-
mator. When there is merely a rearrangement of the population proportion of
an attribute with respect to the study variable, then traditional indirect methods

such as the ratio by Rueda et al. (2011) or the calibration studied in this work
can be applied.
    We have studied four calibration estimators for the proportion which are simple
to calculate from standard calibration packages and can give rise to considerable
increases in the precision achieved, as illustrated by the theoretical results re-
ported here and by the simulation performed. The proposed estimators PbAW and
PbAR can be obtained from any arbitrary sampling design, whereas PbAα and PbAT
estimators are defined under SRSWOR. However, the extension to a stratified
random sampling is straightforward.
    Confidence intervals based on the estimated variances of the studied calibration
estimators is also investigated through a limited simulation study, under a more
realistic survey (stratified random sampling) using real data. PbAα and PbAR have
good properties in confidence estimation, and in some sense (a balance between
length and coverage) the optimal estimator PbAα provides the best results.
