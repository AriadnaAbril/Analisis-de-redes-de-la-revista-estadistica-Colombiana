Abstract
This paper extends the results of the dynamic ordinary least squares cointegration vector estimator available in the literature to a three-dimensional panel. We use a balanced panel of N and M lengths observed over T periods. The cointegration vector is homogeneous across individuals but we allow for individual heterogeneity using different short-run dynamics, individual-specific fixed effects and individual-specific time trends. We also model cross-sectional dependence using time-specific effects. The estimator has a Gaussian sequential limit distribution that is obtained by first letting T → ∞ and then letting N → ∞, M → ∞. The Monte Carlo simulations show evidence that the finite sample properties of the estimator are closely related to the asymptotic ones.

Resumen
Este documento extiende los resultados de los estimadores mínimos cuadrados dinámicos para series cointegradas disponible en la literatura a un panel de tres dimensiones. Se utiliza un panel balanceado de longitudes N y M para un periodo de tiempo de longitud T . El vector de cointegración homogéneo a través de los individuos; sin embargo, el modelo permite cierto grado de heterogeneidad al usar diferentes dinámicas de corto plazo, efectos fijos y tendencias a niveles individuales. También se utilizan efectos en el tiempo para incluir dependencias cruzadas entre los individuos. El estimador tiene una distribución secuencial límite gausiana en la cual primero T → ∞ y posteriormente N → ∞, M → ∞. Simulaciones Monte Carlo muestran evidencia de que las propiedades de muestra finita del estimador son cercanas a las asintóticas.

1. Introduction
    This paper proposes an extension of the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS)
cointegration panel estimators of Mark & Sul (2003) to a three-dimensional panel.
The single equation DOLS for estimating and testing the cointegration hypothesis
was proposed by Phillips & Loretan (1991), Saikkonen (1991), and generalized by
Stock & Watson (1993).
    DOLS is a single-equation cointegration technique that overcomes the common
problems of the static and modified OLS. The static OLS finite sample estimates
of long-run relationships are potentially biased and inferences cannot be drawn
using t-statistics (Banerjee, Hendry & Smith 1986, Kremers, Ericsson & Dolado
1992). DOLS methodology is based on an equation that includes lags and leads of
right-hand side variables, which eliminates the effect of the endogeneity of these
variables. Therefore, it is possible to construct asymptotically-valid test statistics
and also to estimate the long-run relationships.
    Panel DOLS (PDOLS) has been analyzed by Kao & Chiang (2000) and Mark
& Sul (2003). Kao & Chiang (2000) study the properties of panel DOLS when
there are fixed effects in the cointegration regressions. Mark & Sul (2003) allow for
individual heterogeneity through different short-run dynamics, individual-specific
fixed effects and individual-specific time trends. They also permit a limited degree
of cross-sectional dependence through the presence of time-specific effects.
   Panel analysis usually employs two dimensions, being time one of them. How-
ever, given the great availability of data nowadays two dimensions are not always
enough, in these cases, a panel in three dimensions is a relevant option. These
methodologies are very useful as they model the heterogeneity of the data in a
more rigorous way. Some empirical application of panels in three dimensions can
be found in Eilat & Einav (2004), Davies (2006) and Davies, Lahiri & Sheng
(2011), among others1 .
    For extending the results of Mark & Sul (2003) to a three dimensions setup,
we use a balanced panel of three dimensions with lengths N , M and T . The
cointegration vector is homogeneous across individuals but we allow for individual
heterogeneity using different short-run dynamics, individual-specific fixed effects
and individual-specific time trends. Both individual effects are considered in the
first two dimensions. As in Mark & Sul (2003), we also model some degree of
cross-sectional dependence using time-specific effects. After obtaining the Panel
   1 The three dimensions in Eilat & Einav (2004) are time, country of origin and country of

destination, in Davies (2006) and Davies et al. (2011) are individual, forecast horizon and forecast
target (period of time).

3D-Panel Cointegration Vector Estimation                                                                      47

DOLS estimator in three dimensions, PDOLS-3D, we present the sequential limit
distribution of the estimator by first letting T → ∞, then letting N → ∞, M → ∞.
Finally, to evaluate the small sample properties of the PDOLS-3D t-tests, Monte
Carlo experiments are implemented.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
cointegration representation for a three-dimensional panel. Section 3 describes the
PDOLS-3D estimator. The asymptotic distribution of this estimator is presented
in Section 4. A Monte Carlo experiment is implemented in Section 5. Section
6 shows an empirical application of this methodology. Finally, some concluding
remarks are presented in Section 7.


2. Representation of a Cointegrated Model in Panel
   Data in Three Dimensions
   Consider the following triangular representation of a cointegrated system for
a panel with individuals indexed by i = 1, . . . , N and j = 1, . . . , M ? over time
periods t = 1, . . . , T
                           (N )          (M )           (N )           (M )
               yijt = αi          + αj          + λi           t + λj         t + θt + γ 0x ijt + uijt
                                                                                                              (1)
               x ijt = x ijt−1 + v ijt
where {yijt } is the dependent variable integrated of order one, {x          xijt } is a k-
dimensional vector of integrated series of order one and {uijt , v 0ijt }0 is a covariance
stationary error process independent across i and j but possibly dependent across
t. In this case, the variables are said to be cointegrated for each member of the
panel, with cointegrated vector γ . Individual heterogeneity is considered through
different short-run dynamics, individual-specific fixed effects of the first two di-
            (N )      (M )
mensions, αi and αj , and individual-specific time trends in those dimensions,
 (N )       (M )
λi and λj . A limited degree of cross-sectional dependence is also permitted by
the presence of time-specific effects, θt . In this notation, (N ) and (M ) indicate the
first and second dimension, respectively. On the other hand, N and M ? indicate
the number of individuals in the the first and second dimension, respectively.


3. Panel DOLS Estimator in Three Dimensions
    PDOLS methodology is based on the estimation of the following equation
                    (N )          (M )          (N )           (M )
          yijt = αi        + αj          + λi          t + λj         t + θt + γ 0x ijt + δ 0i z ijt + uijt   (2)
                                   x0ijt , . . . , ∆x
                x0ijt−p , . . . , ∆x
where z ijt = (∆x                                   x0ijt+p )0 is a (2p + 1)k-dimensional vector
of leads and lags of the first differences of the variables x ijt . The inclusion of
lags and leads eliminates the effect of the endogeneity of these variables. To avoid
                       (M )   (M )
perfect collinearity, αM ? = λM ? = 0.
    Equation (2) can be expressed as follows,

    The asymptotic distribution of the PDOLS-3D estimator is presented in propo-
sition 1 part (ii). The following lemmas are required to prove this proposition. The
proofs of the lemmas follow from simple extensions of the results of Mark & Sul
(2002). Nevertheless, they are presented in Appendix A, B and C 2
   Following the results of Mark & Sul (2003), a linear hypothesis of the form
Rγ = r can be tested using regular Wald statistics. Let, R a r × k known matrix
and r a r × 1 known vector.

convergence in the three dimensions (N → ∞, M → ∞ and. T → ∞) instead of sequential
convergence.

    This lemma demonstrates the equivalence in probability of the projected series
in the zijt space and the series which are not projected. This gives an asymptotic
justification for ignoring the fact that we are using projection errors instead of the
original observations.

    This proposition presents the sequential limit distribution of the PDOLS-3D
estimator. The proof of part (i) follows from Lemma 2 and Lemma 3.(iii), the
proof of part (ii) follows from Lemma 2 and Lemma 3.(ii). The proof of part (iii)
is straightforward.


5. Monte Carlo Experiments
    This section summarizes the Monte Carlo experiments used for evaluating some
small sample properties of the PDOLS-3D estimator derived in Section 3. The
design of the experiment follows the structure presented in Mark & Sul (2003).
The Data Generating Process (DGP) includes two regressors in the cointegration
relation, and is defined as follows:

                        yijt = αi + αj + γ1 x1,ijt + γ2 x2,ijt + µijt
                     ∆x1,ijt = ν1,ijt
                     ∆x2,ijt = ν2,ijt

     The short run dynamics are given by:

                                     ω ijt = Aij ω ijt−1 +  ijt
                                             p         p

diag σθ21 , σθ22 , σθ23 ], for i = 1, . . . , N , j = 1, . . . , M , where diag(a1 , . . . , an ) is an
n × n diagonal matrix which diagonal elements are a1 , . . . , an ; and Aij is a 3 × 3
matrix whose hr-th element is Ahr,ij for h, r = 1, 2, 3.
    The design of the DGP is also related to the empirical work on the Colom-
bian factor productivity by Iregui, Melo & Ramírez (2007), where the regressors
x1,ijt and x2,ijt represent the level of capital stock and labor force, respectively,
for the i-th industrial sector and j-th metropolitan area in year t. As can be
seen in the specification of the DGP, both regressors are driftless I(1) processes.
The equilibrium error is modeled to allow for a general form of Cross-Sectional
Dependence (CSD), where the CSD is induced by θ1t , while φ controls the degree
of Cross-Sectional Dependence. The parameters θ2t and θ3t cause cross-sectional
endogeneity between the regressors and the equilibrium error.
   The cointegration vector is simulated as (γ1 , γ2 ) = (0.15, 0.85). The values
A11,ij and σhij , for each i and j, are extracted from a uniform distribution, and
are kept constant throughout the experiment. Different levels of persistence in
the short-run dynamics are obtained by varying the limits of the uniform distri-
bution from which the elements of Aij are drawn. Three levels of persistence
are considered: low, A11,ij ∼ U[0.3,0.5] , medium, A11,ij ∼ U[0.5,0.7] , and high,
A11,ij ∼ U[0.7,0.9] . Additionally, different values of φ are used in the simulations:
φ = 0 for no CSD, φ = 0.3 for low CSD, and φ = 0.7 for high CSD.
    Other parameters used in the simulation are as follows: A21,ij ∼ U[-0.05,0.5] ,
A12,ij ∼ U[-0.05,0.5] , A13,ij ∼ U[-0.05,0.5] , A31,ij ∼ U[-0.05,0.5] , A23,ij ∼ U[-0.05,0.5] ,
                                                                     2
A32,ij ∼ U[-0.05,0.5] , A22,ij ∼ U[0.0,0.4] , A33,ij ∼ U[0.0,0.4] , σ1,ij ∼ U[1×10−3 ,53×10−3 ] ,
  2                                   2
σ2,ij ∼ U[0.25×10−3 ,1.34×10−3 ] , σ3,ij ∼ U[2.3×10−3 ,57×10−3 ] ; and σθ21 = 1.8, σθ22 =
0.645, σθ23 = 2.0 for i = 1, . . . , N , j = 1, . . . , M . The prewhitened quadratic spec-
tral methodology proposed by Sul, Phillips & Choi (2005) was used for estimating
the long-run variances Ωuu,ij . The values of the individual-specific fixed effects of
the first two dimensions, αi and αj , are taken from the PDOLS-3D estimation with
the data in Iregui et al. (2007). The simulation structure includes 1,000 samples
of size N = 9, M = 18, and T = 50 or T = 100 or T = 150. The number of leads
and lags of ∆x xijt included in the PDOLS-3D estimation is taken as two. Then,
three cases are evaluated:
     Case 1: No CSD (φ = 0), with low, medium and high persistence levels.
   Case 2: Homogeneous CSD (A11,ij = A11,lk , for i, l = 1, . . . , N , j, k = 1, . . . , M ),
with low and high CSD degrees (φ = 0.3, φ = 0.7); and with low, medium and
high persistence levels.

   Tables 1 to 9 report the results of the simulation experiments described in cases
1 to 3 for N = 18 and M = 9. Tables 1, 4 and 7 present the simulations with

    The effective size results for Case 1 with 5% and 10% nominal-sized tests and
T = 50 are presented in Table 1. Under low levels of persistence, the tests’ effective
sizes are fairly accurate; nevertheless, the results for H0 : γ2 = 0.85 are slightly
better than those for H0 : γ1 = 0.15. For medium levels of persistence, there is a
loss of size accuracy of the tests relative to low persistence levels, in nominal sizes
of both 10% and 5%. For high levels of persistence, the test sizes for both γ1 and
γ2 are notably smaller than their nominal sizes.
    Table 2 shows the results obtained for Case 1 with T = 100. Under medium
and high levels of persistence, the effective sizes are closer to the nominal sizes
than they were when T = 50. When T = 100 the tests for low levels of persistence
are not as accurate as those for T = 50. However, the results are not very different.
The results for Case 1 with T = 150, presented in Table 3, are very similar to the
ones obtained for T = 100.

    The size results of PDOLS-3D tests for Case 2, with T = 50 are shown in
Table 4. When the CSD degree is low, the test for γ2 is accurate at low levels
of persistence, and effective size becomes smaller when persistence increases to
medium and high levels. For γ1 , the test is mis-sized when the persistence is
low, and its effective size decreases when the persistence reaches medium and high
levels.

    In Case 2 under high CSD for the simulations presented in Table 4, the tests
are, in general, not as well sized as they were in low CSD. For example, for γ2
the effective sizes in low and medium levels of persistence are not as accurate as
under low CSD. Even though the tests are highly mis-sized for some cases, the
test accuracy improves when the level of persistence increases.
    Table 5 presents the test sizes for case 2 with T = 100. Under low CSD, the
test results generally improve with respect to those presented in Table 4, specially
for γ1 . Under high CSD, the increase in the time dimension improves the accuracy
of the tests under low, medium, and some cases of high persistence levels. The
simulations for T = 150 produce even better results, as is showed in Table 6.
    The results for Case 3 with T = 50 are reported in Table 7. Size results are
closer to the nominal levels in the presence of low CSD than in the presence of high
CSD, for low and medium persistence levels. Additionally, as in the previous cases
described in Tables 1 and 4, size decreases when persistence approaches higher
levels. This leads to small and mis-sized tests for γ1 in high persistence levels. It
is also important to note that, in most of the cases, the results of Case 3 are not
very different from those obtained in Case 2.

   Size results for Case 3 and T = 100 are shown in Table 8. When the CSD
degree is low, there are gains in accuracy for the γ1 tests in all persistence levels
compared with simulations of Table 7. However, there are some cases with no
improvement for γ2 . These gains are also obtained under high CSD for most of
the cases. For T = 150 (Table 9), size distortions are, in general, smaller.

    In conclusion, there are four relevant observations related to the simulation
experiments. First, nominal and effective sizes are, in general, close enough. Sec-
ond, persistence levels and size are negatively related; as the level of persistence
is increased, effective size systematically decreases. Third, the results of the effec-
tive size in Cases 2 and 3 are relatively similar, which indicates that subtracting
the cross-sectional average is an effective way to control CSD, even in the pres-
ence of heterogeneous CSD. Finally, as expected, increasing the time dimension,
in general, improves the accuracy of the tests.

6. Empirical Application

    As an empirical exercise, we estimate capital and labor elasticities associated
with the total factor productivity for the Colombian industry. This exercise is
useful, since productivity is a variable that reflects how efficiently an economy uses
its resources to produce goods and services and helps to determine the distribution
of value added between capital and labor.
    Assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function, we obtain the following equa-

                                   Yijt = Aij Kijt Lβijt                                (11)

where Y is value added, K is capital stock, L is labor, A corresponds to total
factor productivity, α and β are the elasticities of capital and labor, respectively,
and α + β = 1. The subscripts i, j and t represent metropolitan areas, industry
sectors and time, respectively.
   Taking logarithms on both sides of equation (11) we get:

                         ln Yijt = ln Aij + α ln Kijt + β ln Lijt                       (12)


    To estimate equation (12) we employ the dataset used in Iregui et al. (2007).
They use data from the annual manufacturing industry survey (EAM) of the na-
tional administrative department of statistics (DANE). The value added is calcu-
lated as the difference between gross output and intermediate inputs, where the
latter corresponds to the value of domestic and foreign consumed raw materials
and the value of purchased electricity (kw/h). Labor is defined as the number of
employees. And finally, capital stock was calculated using the perpetual inventory
method for gross investment3 .
   This data includes annual information for 9 metropolitan areas and 18 in-
dustrial sectors (three-digits CIIU) from 1975 to 2000. The metropolitan areas
considered are: Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, Manizales, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga,
Pereira and Cartagena and the rest of the country.
    The estimated parameters of (12) are presented in Table 10. As indicated in
section 3, these estimations are obtained controlling for individual-specific fixed ef-
fects in the metropolitan areas and industrial sector dimensions, individual-specific
time trends in those dimensions and cross-sectional dependence. These results
show that the elasticities of capital and labor are 0.24 and 0.76, respectively.
These elasticities are similar to those found in Colombian literature. For exam-
ple, a technical document from Secretaría de Hacienda Distrital (2003) estimated
coefficients of 0.27 and 0.72 for capital and labor, respectively; and Eslava, Halti-
wanger, Kugler & Kugler (2004) found elasticities of 0.32 for capital and 0.74 for
labor for the period 1982-1998.

7. Final Remarks
    This paper extends the asymptotic results of the dynamic ordinary least squares
cointegration vector estimator of Mark & Sul (2003) to a three dimensional panel
(PDOLS-3D). This method allows for individual heterogeneity using different
short-run dynamics, individual-specific fixed effects and individual specific time
trends. Also some degree of cross-sectional dependence is considered by the use
of time-specific effects. A convenient feature of this method is that it permits the
construction of asymptotically-valid test statistics for hypothesis testing.
    The proposed estimators have also acceptable finite sample properties. Through-
out the Monte Carlo experiments it was found that the effective sizes of the
PDOLS-3D t-tests are relatively close to the nominal sizes, for different persistence
levels of the series, and different forms and degrees of cross-sectional dependence.
