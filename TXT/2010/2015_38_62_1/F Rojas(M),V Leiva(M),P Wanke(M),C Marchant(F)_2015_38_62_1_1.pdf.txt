Abstract
We propose a methodology useful for food services, allowing contribution margins to be optimized. This is based on statistical tools, inventory models and financial indicators. To reduce the gap between theory and practice, we apply this methodology to the case study of a Chilean company to show its potential. We conduct a real-world demand data analysis for perishable and non-perishable products in the company’s inventory assortment. Then, we use suitable inventory models to optimize the associated costs. We compare the proposed optimized system with the non-optimized system currently employed by the company, using financial indicators.
Key words: Data Analysis, Demand, Distributions, Inventory.

2. Introduction
    Supply systems and inventory policies affect company logistics positively, min-
imizing the costs involved, and reducing inefficiencies in their management. It
is known that total inventory cost is a function of purchasing (PC), ordering
(OC) and storing (SC) costs; see Hillier & Lieberman (2005). Several authors
have discussed the importance of having optimal supply and inventory policies
in a company together with efficient logistics management; see Blankley, Khouja
& Wiggins (2008) and Kogan & Tell (2009). These aspects of logistics are also
present in collective food service companies; see Ramirez (2013). Such services
prepare menu food portions according to diverse specifications, including nutri-
tional and sanitary issues, based on the different types of clients who consume this
menu; see Marambio, Parker & Benavides (2005). The increase in food services is
generating an important source of employment in countries and providing multiple
market opportunities. This is attributed to people needing to eat out due to activ-
ities related to businesses, factories, hospitals, schools and universities. Because
of service diversity, the complexity of this food industry has grown considerably,

requiring professional management and regulation by government agencies; see
MINSAL (2004).
    In Chile food services are deemed as small and medium enterprises. Many
of these Chilean services are not optimizing their supply of raw materials. Such
materials make up their inventory assortment that is divided in perishable (fruits,
meats, vegetables) and non-perishable products with greater storing capacity sub-
ject to shortage; see Grant, Karagianni & Li (2006). Logistics of these raw materi-
als is based on monthly planning of the menus guided by nutritional considerations.
The management of logistics can be improved by using inventory policies that al-
low contribution margins (CMs) of company to be increased; see Soman (2006)
and Nicolau (2005) for a case study of hotels. CMs are the gross profits of a com-
pany and summarize the movements of income and costs, which may be direct
(variable costing) and indirect (absorption costing). These margins vary depend-
ing on product units sold, unit costs, ratio between them, and the total costs and
fixed costs involved; see Ramanathan (2006).
    An optimal inventory policy can be attained choosing the most adequate inven-
tory model, which involves several aspects; see Botter & Fortuin (2000), Braglia,
Eaves & Kingsman (2004), Braglia, Grassi & Montanari (2004), Wanke (2011)
and Wanke (2012). When non-perishable (multi-period) products are considered,
inventory models are classified in two types: pull and push, ranging from the eco-
nomic order quantity (EOQ) to the just in time (JIT) supply; see Wanke (2009).
The EOQ model is the cornerstone of several software packages for inventory con-
trol and is widely used in practice; see Nahmias (2001). The JIT method is useful
for raw materials that can be supplied as timely as they are required, however it
imposes constraints on logistics limiting its use for certain types of products in
food services; see Carter, Carter, Monczka, Slaight & Swan (2000) and Wanke,
Arkader & Rodrigues (2008). Chiu (2010) discussed models for multi-period prod-
ucts where shortage is not permitted, seeking to find the EOQ and reorder point
(ROP), appropriate for groceries often used by food services. Considering lead
time (LT) in the modeling renders its assumptions to be more adherent to real
world settings; see Ben-Daya & Raouf (1994). The EOQ model is used altogether
with the ROP in inventory control to determine safety stocks (SS) under both
random LT and demand, which randomness directly affects the operation of a
logistics system; see Speh & Wagenheim (1978) and Wanke (2009). Perishable
(single-period) products can only be stored during a limited period. These prod-
ucts usually are fruits, meats and vegetables, which are essential raw materials
in food services. When contemplating this type of products, the model based on
the critical ratio (CR) or service level is often employed; see Hillier & Lieberman
(2005, pp. 961-975).
    Multiple and single period models must consider that the demanded quantity
of a product cannot accurately be predicted owing to several factors, making it
to be a random variable (RV) and, therefore, its behavior must be described by a
statistical distribution (or probabilistic model); see Johnson, Kotz & Balakrishnan
(1994). The Gaussian (or normal) distribution is often used for describing data
of three RVs involved in inventory models: demand, LT, and lead-time demand.
It is known that this distribution is validly used for RVs that take negative and


                                      Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 1–30

positive values. Therefore, quantities less than zero can be admitted in the mod-
eling, although, in practice, this is not possible for the three mentioned RVs; see
Keaton (1995) and Nahmias (2001). Mentzer & Krishnan (1988) studied the non-
normality effect on inventory control, indicating that demand for products present-
ing a normal distribution is found in few practical cases. This is because demand
data often follow asymmetric distributions; see Moors & Strijbosch (2002). In any
case, the normality assumption must be checked by goodness-of-fit methods; see
Castro-Kuriss, Kelmansky, Leiva & Martinez (2009), Castro-Kuriss, Kelmansky,
Leiva & Martinez (2010), Barros, Leiva, Ospina & Tsuyuguchi (2014) and Castro-
Kuriss, Leiva & Athayde (2014). Thus, using the normal distribution to model
the demand and LT, and to determine the ROP and SS, may provoke wrong re-
sults, leading to stock shortage or excess. Some non-normal distributions used for
describing demand or LT in inventory models are the gamma or Erlang, inverse
Gaussian (IG), lognormal (LN), uniform and Weibull; see Burgin (1975), Tadika-
malla (1981), Lau (1989), Wanke (2008) and Cobb, Rumí & Salmerón (2013).
    A probability model with positive asymmetry currently receiving considerable
attention is the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution; see Johnson et al. (1994,
pp. 651-663). This is due to its good properties and its relation with the normal
distribution, which permits the BS distribution to behave as the LN distribution,
but with properties that the LN does not have. Its applications range across diverse
fields including business and industry; see Jin & Kawczak (2003), Bhatti (2010),
Ahmed, Castro-Kuriss, Flores, Leiva & Sanhueza (2010), Leiva, Soto, Cabrera &
Cabrera (2011), Vilca, Sanhueza, Leiva & Christakos (2010), Sanhueza, Leiva &
López-Kleine (2011), Villegas, Paula & Leiva (2011), Ferreira, Gomes & Leiva
(2012), Leiva, Ponce, Marchant & Bustos (2012), Paula, Leiva, Barros & Liu
(2012), Leiva, Santos-Neto, Cysneiros & Barros (2014), Marchant, Bertin, Leiva
& Saulo (2013), Leiva, Marchant, Saulo, Aslam & Rojas (2014), Leiva, Rojas,
Galea & Sanhueza (2014) and Leiva, Saulo, Leao & Marchant (2014). The BS
distribution includes the duration of the counting period (daily or weekly), which
can be changed without collecting extra data, among other interesting properties,
allowing the BS distribution to be a good candidate for describing demand data;
see Fox, Gavish & Semple (2012).
    A good statistical modeling of demand data and a scientific management of
inventories for food service companies can maximize their CMs, resulting in bet-
ter competitiveness, efficiency and profitability of these companies. This can be
helpful in making optimal decisions.
    The main objective of this paper is to propose a methodology useful for food
services allowing CMs to be optimized. This methodology is based on statistical
tools, inventory management models and financial indicators. Specifically, the
methodology uses probabilistic models that describe the behavior of demand data
for raw materials employed by food services that prepare a daily menu. Hereafter,
we refer to these raw materials as components (or products) forming part of a
food menu. Then, the logistics process is optimized by using inventory models that
depend on the type of product from the corresponding assortment. Hence, the CMs
of the company are measured by using absorption costing and improved by means
of logistics management. Such an improvement is evidenced when comparing the

financial results obtained from the optimized system with respect to the non-
optimized system used by the food service. Since certain authors have stressed
the need for conducting case studies to reduce the gap between theory and practice
and enable researchers to increase their background (Wagner & Lindemann 2008),
we apply this methodology to the case study of a food company that serves the
staff of a Chilean hospital.
   This paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, we propose our methodology.
In Section 4, we conduct a case study for a Chilean food service. In Section 5, we
provide an illustration for one product from the inventory assortment. Finally, in
Section 6, we discuss the conclusions of this study.


3. Methodology
    In this section, we provide a methodology for food services that allows CMs
to be optimized. First, we discuss the assumptions and the limitations of our
methodology. Second, we mention how demand data for components of a food
menu should be collected. Third, we present the statistical tools needed to fit a
demand data set to a suitable distribution. Fourth, we detail inventory manage-
ment models to be used for optimizing the supply system based on the selected
distributions. Fifth, we describe the financial indicators of our methodology. An
algorithm that summarizes this methodology is provided.


3.1. Assumptions and Limitations
    The main assumptions of our methodology are (i) random demand, (ii) demand
time series free of seasonality and trend, (iii) independent component demand, (iv)
constant LT and (v) the need to ascertain managerial costing calculations. Some
limitations of our methodology are related to (i) additional research needed to
improve the results, especially by introducing aspects to better reflect real world
settings, such as issues related to seasonality, trend and independence, and (ii)
relevant costs of operation characteristics.
    Note that shortage costs for non-perishable products might be unavailable and
therefore not incorporated in the analysis. Unlike situation proposals by Silver,
Pyke & Peterson (1998) and Zipkin (2010), in our methodology, there are no
CMs or penalties imposed to a product with unsatisfied demand. In practice, for
food companies, a product is replaced by another when unavailable and customers
continue consuming their meals. We set a target level of service based on a safety
factor (SF), instead of the simultaneous optimization of EOQ and SF. This is due
to the eminently practical nature of our study, which aim is, among others, the
transfer of knowledge and management of inventory policy over time to the studied
company. Using the SF in an inventory policy necessarily requires the manager to
think in terms of service level and inventory segmentation by levels of criticality
with respect to shortage of items. When the simultaneous optimization of EOQ
and SF is carried out, these issues are less explicit for the manager.

3.2. Recording the Data
    We recommend designing and implementing a system of record for all products
comprising the inventory assortment of raw materials of the food service company.
This system must be based on identification codes, unit PC, demanded quantity,
price, date and time of entry and exit of products used in the preparation of
food portions; see Harvey (2002) and Yajiong (2005). The system of record must
be based on individual identification using bar codes and developed for demand
profiles of the products in the inventory assortment, throughout the period planned
for the study. We recommend a period of six months (26 weeks). Initially, we
considered 26 weeks (half a year) as a sample of convenience based on the project’s
budget for data collection. However, we were able to collect data for one week
more. This additional week was considered to increase the sample size.


3.3. Demand Statistical Distributions
    Based on the system of record mentioned in Subsection 3.2, demand data
needed to model the distribution of the demand for each component must be col-
lected and then the demand distribution fitted. Until very recently, one of the
problems for using a demand distribution different from the normal model was
the limitation of statistical software. However, today this is not a problem, first
because currently we have a number of statistical software that has implemented
several statistical distributions and, second, the scientific community has at its dis-
posal a non-commercial and open source software for statistics and graphs, named
R, which can be obtained at no cost from www.r-project.org. The statistical
software R is nowadays very popular in the international scientific community.
Then, to perform a statistical analysis of demand data, we use the R software
and also employ some of its packages to carry out more specific statistical analy-
sis. As mentioned, the gamma, IG, LN, uniform and Weibull distributions have
been used for modeling the demand or the LT in inventory problems and they
are implemented in R software packages named gamlss and ig; see Stasinopoulos
& Rigby (2007) and Leiva, Hernandez & Sanhueza (2008). Statistical analysis
based on BS distributions, including a version known as the BS-Student-t (BS-t)
distribution, which has been proven to provide robust estimates of its parameters
against outliers (Paula et al. 2012), can be conducted by means of an R software
package named gbs; see Barros, Paula & Leiva (2009). Next, we provide some
useful results for all of these distributions; see details in Johnson et al. (1994).
The BS Distribution. A RV D following the BS distribution with shape α > 0
and scale β > 0 parameters is denoted by D ∼ BS(α, β), where “∼” means “dis-
tributed as”. In this case, the probability density (PDF) and cumulative distribu-
tion (CDF) functions of D are respectively

quantile function (QF) is d(q) = FD       (q) = β[αz(q)/2 + (αz(q)/2)2 + 1]2 , for

of the distribution. The mean and variance of D are E[D] = β[1 + α2 /2] and
Var[D] = β 2 α2 [1 + 5α2 /4]. p
                              In addition, BS RVs (D) and standard normal (Z) are
related by D = β[αZ/2 + (αZ/2)2 + 1]2 ∼ BS(α, β) and Z = [1/α]ξ(D/β) ∼
N(0, 1). Also, W = Z 2 follows a chi-squared distribution with one degree of
freedom, which is useful for goodness of fit. The BS distribution holds the scale and
reciprocal properties, that is, c D ∼ BS(α, c β), with c > 0, and 1/D ∼ BS (α, 1/β),
respectively.
The BS-t Distribution. A RV D following the BS-t distribution with shape
α > 0, ν > 0 and scale β > 0 parameters is denoted by D ∼ BS-t(α, β, ν). In this
case, the PDF and CDF of D are

again d(q) = FD     (q) = β[αz(q)/2 + (αz(q)/2)2 + 1]2 , for 0 < q < 1, but now
z(q) is the QF of the Student-t distribution with ν degrees of freedom. Note
that β is once again the median or 50th percentile of the distribution. The mean
and variance of D are E[D] = β[1 + Aα2 /2] and Var[D] = β 2 α2 [A + 5Bα2 /4],
where A = ν/[ν − 2], for ν > 2, and B = 3ν 2 /[(ν − 2)(ν − 4)], for ν > 4. Now,
BS RVs (D) and Student-t (Z) are related by D = β[αZ/2 + (αZ/2)2 + 1]2 ∼
BS-t(α, β; ν) and Z = [1/α]ξ(D/β) ∼ t(ν). In this case, W = Z 2 follows a Fisher
distribution with one degree of freedom in the numerator and ν degrees of freedom
in the denominator, which also is useful for goodness of fit purposes. Some of its
properties are: c D ∼ BS-t(α, c β, ν), with c > 0, and 1/D ∼ BS-t(α, 1/β, ν).
The Gamma Distribution. A RV D following the gamma distribution with
shape α > 0 and scale β > 0 parameters is denoted by D ∼ Gamma(α, β). In this
case, the PDF and CDF of D are

               [α2 β]1/α2 Γ(1/α2 )                        Γ(1/α2 )

                                                   −1
tively. The corresponding QF given by d(q) = FD       (q), for 0 < q < 1, must be
obtained by solving this equation with an iterative numerical method. The mean
and variance of D are E[D] = β and Var[T ] = α2 β 2 , respectively. The gamma
distribution also shares the property c D ∼ Gamma(α, c β), with c > 0.
The Inverse Gaussian Distribution. A RV D following the IG distribution
with mean λ > 0 and scale β > 0 parameters is denoted by D ∼ IG(λ, β). In this
case, the PDF and CDF of D are

                                                          −1
and once again the corresponding QF given by d(q) = FD       (q), for 0 < q < 1, must
be obtained by solving this equation with an iterative numerical method. The
mean and variance of D are E[D] = λ and Var[D] = λ3 /β, respectively. The IG
distribution also shares the scale property, that is, c D ∼ IG(c λ, c β), with c > 0.
The Lognormal Distribution. If Y = log(D) has a normal distribution with
mean µ and variance α2 , that is, Y = log(D) ∼ N(µ, α2 ), then the RV D follows
the LN distribution with shape α > 0 and scale β = exp(µ) > 0 parameters. The
notation D ∼ LN(α, β) is used in this case. Thus, the PDF and CDF of D are

                         [log(d) − log(β)]2
                                                                             
            1                                                   log(d) − log(β)
fD (d) =    √ exp −                           and F D (d) = Φ                     ,
         d α 2π                 2α2                                    α
                                              −1
for d > 0. The corresponding QF is d(q) = FD     (q) = β exp(z(q)α), for 0 < q < 1,
where z(q) is the standard normal QF. The mean and variance of D are E[D] =
β exp(α2 /2) and Var[D] = β 2 [exp(2α2 ) − exp(α2 )], respectively.
The Weibull Distribution. A RV D following the Weibull distribution with
shape α > 0 and scale β > 0 parameters is denoted by D ∼ Wei(α, β). In this
case, the PDF and CDF of D are
                α−1
                       h iα                         h iα 
   fD (d) = α dβ α exp − βd     and FD (d) = 1 − exp − βd     , d > 0.

The QF of D is d(q) = β[− log(1 − q)]1/α , for 0 < q < 1, and its mean and variance
are                                              h          α+1  2 i
       E[D] = β Γ α+1       and Var[D] = β 2 Γ α+2

                     α                                α    − Γ α          .

Data Analysis, Parameter Estimation and Goodness-of-Fit of Distribu-
tions. As mentioned, R is a free software environment for statistical computing
and graphics. Using this software (i) exploratory data analysis (EDA) can be
conducted for diagnosing the statistical features present in the demand data; (ii)
estimation of the parameters of the BS, BS-t, gamma, IG, LN and Weibull dis-
tributions can be carried out by the popular maximum likelihood (ML) method,
and (iii) goodness-of-fit of a distribution to a demand data set can be performed
by Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests and probability
plots. Next, we describe the R commands of the gbs, ig and basics packages and
briefly illustrate their use.
    First, the R software must be downloaded from CRAN.r-project.org and in-
stalled as any other software. Second, this software can be used in a simple inter-
active form with the R commander by installing the Rcmdr package. Third, the
gbs and ig packages must be also installed. Data analyses based on the BS and

BS-t distributions can be performed with the gbs package, for the IG distribution
with the ig package and for the gamma, LN and Weibull distributions with the
basics or gamlss packages. Thus, once these packages are installed, they must be
loaded into the R software, for example, by the command library(gbs) typing
them at the R prompt of the R commander, or with any editor program that the
user is considering. Once all these instructions are completed, the data, for exam-
ple, “component1”, must be loaded as data(component1). The data can also be
directly typed by the R commander such as an Excel sheet or imported from text
files, from other statistical software or from Excel. Table 2 provides examples of
some commands that allow us to work with the BS distribution, similar instruc-
tions may be used for other distributions; for more details about how to use the
gbs package, see Barros et al. (2009).

3.4. Inventory Management Models
    Once the most suitable demand distribution is chosen from the pool presented
in Subsection 3.3, the appropriate inventory management model must be applied
taking into account if the product (component) is (i) perishable –under a single
period–, (ii) non-perishable –under multiple periods–, or (iii) supplied under the
JIT method. Thus, depending on the type of product, we obtain the quantity
to be replenished that minimizes the PCs, OCs and SCs according to one of the
following inventory models:
(M1) Model for non-perishable products or (Q, r): considers that the quantity
needed to optimize the OCs and SCs is based on the EOQ model given by
                                   r
                                      2 λ OC
                               Q=            ,                            (1)
                                        SC
where λ is the demand rate in units of the product per time unit, calculated as
the mean (expected value) according to the distribution that adequately fits the

                                         Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 1–30

data. In the model M1, we must also consider the ROP, which is the level that
an inventory must have in stock when a purchase order is placed, calculated as
r0 = l λ, where λ is defined in (1) and l is the constant LT. However, given that
random consumption occurs causing demand uncertainties, to protect against such
uncertainties, it is necessary to include a SS and the ROP becomes

                                  r = µDl + SS,                                    (2)

where µDl = E[Dl ] = l λ is the mean of the demand during the LT (Dl ) and
SS = kq σDl , with kq being the SF associated with a service level q × 100%, or
amount ofp standard deviations
                       √       (SD) of the demanded quantity during the LT given
by σDl = Var[Dl ] = l σ. As noted in (2), it is necessary to know the demand
distribution during the LT to determine the SF; see Keaton (1995). This factor
can be established by using some percentile of the demand during the LT. To be
protected against any unexpected logistics situation, the 95th percentile is usually
considered, that is, q = 0.95. Thus, k0.95 must be obtained from the statistical
distribution that adequately fits the demand data during LT.
    Note that in the model M1 is not considered a shortage cost of the product,
because, in the event of a shortage, it is possible to produce an emergency menu,
to avoid any unsatisfied demand of the final product (menu); see details about
this model and it assumptions in Hillier & Lieberman (2005, pp. 956-961). Also,
we recall that no simultaneous optimization of Q and r is carried out due to the
practical nature of our methodology; see details in Subsection 3.2.
(M2) Model for perishable products: it considers the quantity needed to optimize
the cost of ordering one unit less (generating temporary shortage), in contrast
to ordering one unit more (generating temporary overstock), based on the CR
in this case given by CR = [UC − PC]/[UC + HC], where UC is the unsatisfied
demand shortage cost per unit, that includes lost revenue and loss cost of customer
goodwill, PC is expressed as a purchasing cost per unit of the product, and HC
is the holding cost per unit, per day, that includes the SC minus a salvage value
of a product unit. The numerator UC − PC results in a decrease in profit, due
to not ordering a unit that could have been sold during such period, whereas the
denominator UC + HC results also in decrease in profit, but due to ordering a
unit that could not be sold during such period. Thus, the single period model
for perishable products allows us to obtain the optimum stored quantity from the
optimum service level given by

                                  FD (d0 ) = CR,                                   (3)

where FD (·) is the CDF of the demanded quantity and d0 the optimum quantity
of ordered units; see details in Hillier & Lieberman (2005, pp. 961-975).
(M3) JIT model: it is the just quantity for production, it does not take storage
into account and is used for specific products requested for completing the daily
menu of the food service company. A Kanban type information system can be
used in this case, which allows the availability of the product to be harmonically
coordinated; see Carter et al. (2000).

3.5. Determination of Financial Indicators
    Once an appropriate inventory management model is chosen from M1, M2 or
M3 (see Subsection 3.4), the CM for each of p products (components) of the inven-
tory assortment used in the preparation of a food menu portion must be calculated,
based on the income obtained during w weeks for the company corresponding to
this menu. The quantities of each component used in the preparation of the menu
(ingredients) are determined with its respective consumption measuring unit; see
Table 12 in Appendix for an example on the equivalence among these units for the
products of the case study included in Section 4.
  The prorated demand of the product i in the jth week can be obtained by
means of the proportion that each product of the food portion holds weekly in the
menu calculated according to

               PDi,j = DQi,j /DQj ,           i = 1, . . . , p,      j = 1, . . . , w,     (4)

where DQi,j is the demanded quantity of the product i in the jth week and DQj
is the demanded quantity for all the products during that week. The income of
the company for all the portions of the food menu sold during the jth week is

                             I j = Nj S j ,      j = 1, . . . , w,                         (5)

where Nj is the number of menus sold and Sj is the price of the food menu portion,
both of them in the jth week. Thus, the prorated income derived from the product
i during the jth week is obtained as

                  PIi,j = Ij PDi,j ,    i = 1, . . . , p,         j = 1, . . . , w,        (6)

where PDi,j and Ij are defined in (4) and (5), respectively. The PC for the product
i in the jth week is

               PCi,j = NCi,j PQi,j ,          i = 1, . . . , p,      j = 1, . . . , w,     (7)

where NCi,j and PQi,j are the unit net cost and the purchased quantity of the
product i during the jth week, respectively. Note that, for the optimized system
with the inventory model for non-perishable products, PQi,j must be estimated
from Q given in (1), whereas, in the case of perishable products, PQi,j must be
estimated from d0 − Lj given in (3), with Lj being the stock level at the beginning
of the jth week. For the non-optimized system, this value can be empirically
calculated. Once financial indicators PIi,j and PCj defined in (6) and (7) are
obtained, the variable contribution margin (VCM) of the product i during the jth
week must be computed as

              VCMi,j = PIi,j − PCi,j ,          i = 1, . . . , p,      j = 1, . . . , w.   (8)

   The OC for the product i during the jth week can be obtained as

                 OCi,j = OCi /52,        i = 1, . . . , p,        j = 1, . . . , w,        (9)

where OCi is the annual OC of the product i given by OCi = h=1 OChi OQi ,
with OQi being the annual order quantity and OChi the cost of type h given
in Table 3, both for the product i. Note that, for the optimized system with
the inventory model for non-perishable products, OQi must be estimated from Q
given in (1) using the expression λ/Q for each product (with λ being expressed as
a demand rate per year), whereas in the case of perishable products OQi = 52,
for all i = 1, . . . , p. For the non-optimized system, this value can be empirically
calculated.

     The SC for the product i during the jth week is
                  SCi,j = [SCi /52] SQi,j ,           j = 1, . . . , w,
                                               i = 1, . . . , p,               (10)
                                                              P5
where SCi is the annual SC of the product i given by SCi = k=1 SCki /SQi , with
                                                                      P52
SCki being the annual SC of type k defined in Table 4 and SQi = j=1 SQi,j the
annual stored quantity, both for the product i, and SQi,j is the stored quantity of
the product i in the jth week. Note that, for the optimized system with the in-
ventory management model for non-perishable products, SQi,j must be estimated
from SQ = Q/2 + SS, where Q and SS are given in (1) and (2), respectively,
whereas, in the case of perishable products, SQi,j must be estimated from the ex-
pected inventory level by single period. For the non-optimized system, this value
can be empirically calculated.

Optimizing Contribution Margins with Demand Models                                              13

   We consider CMs as absorbable by sales with respect to indirect costs, which
are subtracted from the VCM given in (8) to obtain the total CM of the product
i during the jth week as

        CMi,j = VCMi,j − [OCi,j + SCi,j ],             i = 1, . . . , p,   j = 1, . . . , w,   (11)

where VCMi,j , OCi,j and SCi,j are given in (8), (9) and (10), respectively. Thus,
we collect a series of CMs for p products (one for each of them). Hence, the CM
of all the products of the inventory assortment during the jth week is CMj =
P  p
   i=1 CMi,j , for j = 1 . . . , w, where CMi,j is given in (11). Therefore, the total
CM of the inventory system is
                                               w
                                               X
                                     CM =            CMj .                                     (12)
                                               j=1

Note that the objective function to be maximized is the sum of CMi,j for the
product i in the jth week, during the entire period of study totalizing w weeks, for
the menu composed by p products with independent demand. Here, the margins
VCMi,j and costs OCj and SCi,j depend on the inventory model of the product
i. This function is expressed as
                 p X
                 X w                 p X
                                     X w
                           CMi,j =             [VCMi,j − OCi,j − SCi,j ].
                 i=1 j=1             i=1 j=1

Since our approach to calculating (i) CMs from the differential revenues and (ii)
costs from the movements in and out of the inventory assortment is based on
independent components (products) and not on the menu, absorbable costs for
ordering and storing are also calculated using the same criteria of independence
and considering the spread of demand from the proportion of components used in
the menu. This approach turns out to be more streamlined, because it does not
consider the correlations that might exist between components of the menu, which
is a source for future work; see Section 6.


3.6. Summary of the Methodology
    Algorithm 1 summarizes our methodology in six main steps divided into 13 sub-
steps based on the aspects detailed in Subsections 3.2 to 3.5, from the collection of
data until the establishment of the CMs to evaluate the optimized system in rela-
tion to the current (non-optimized) system. We recall this algorithm considers the
demand for independent components, but once all the components are considered,
the total contribution of the components used in the service are maximized.

Algorithm 1 Main methodological steps
1: Collect demand data for the product i in each day of the w weeks (i = 1, . . . , p).
2: For the statistical analysis:
   2.1 Carry out a correlation study for data collected in Step 1 to detect possible seasonality,
   trend or dependence. If neither autocorrelation nor correlation between components are
   detected, then an EDA for independent data must be conducted. Otherwise, these seasonality
   and/or trend must be removed using suitable techniques.
   2.2 Propose distributions for the demand data analyzed in Step 2.1 based on the EDA.
   2.3 Estimate the parameters of the distributions proposed in Step 2.2.
   2.4 Apply goodness-of-fit tests establishing the most adequate distribution.
3: For the inventory analysis:
   3.1 Select the suitable inventory model depending on the type of product i.
   3.2 Find the optimal inventory elements (Q, r, d0 ) based on distributions established in Step
   2.4.
4: For the financial analysis:
   4.1 Compute the VCM for the product i in the jth week of the optimal policy obtained in
   Step 3.2.
   4.2 Determine the corresponding OC for the product i in the jth week.
   4.3 Calculate the SC for the product i in the jth week.
   4.4 Obtain the CM for the product i in the jth week.
5: Repeat steps 1 to 4 until completing p products.
6: Establish the optimized total CM and compare it with the non-optimized total CM.




4. Case Study
    In this section, given need to conduct case studies focusing on their applicability
in firms to reduce the gap between theory and practice, we apply the methodology
summarized in Algorithm 1 to an anonymous Chilean food company, which serves
the staff of a hospital in the city of Valparaiso. This case study enables researchers
to increase their practical knowledge of the aspects involved and understand the
complexity of this environment and the managerial efforts made by firms become
evident.
   This study was leaded by Fernando Rojas and Victor Leiva in the University
of Valparaiso-Chile (www.uv.cl) by means of the project grant DIUV 14/2009,
during w = 27 weeks covering the period since 20-Nov-2011 to 26-May-2012 (189
days). Details of p = 89 products of the inventory assortment considered in this
study are provided in Table 12 with their respective equivalence units.
    We bring to mind that unsatisfied demand shortage costs for non-perishable
products are unavailable for their incorporation into the analysis, on account that
there are no CMs or penalties imposed for a product with unsatisfied demand.
If a product is missing, it is replaced by a similar item. Moreover, owing to the
practical nature of this study, for non-perishable products, we set a service level
based on a SF instead of simultaneously optimizing Q and r.
   As mentioned, the data were collected during the period indicated above fol-
lowing the system of record in Subsection 3.2. Note that, in the type of data that
we analyze (food services for hospitals), seasonality or trend factors usually are
not present; see Step 2 of Algorithm 1. We have also explored the correlation
between some products and only a small correlation but marginally not significant

was detected, hence we discarded this aspect. In any case, some comments in
this line are provided in the conclusions of this study. Moreover, demand data
are usually observed over time. Then, one must check whether these data are
time dependent or not. An autocorrelation graphical analysis detected that the
corresponding autocorrelations are very small, so that dependence on time can be
discarded too. This graphical analysis can be corroborated by the Durbin-Watson
test and its bootstrapped p-value to examine independence in these data.
    Second, we carry out a statistical analysis of these data from the EDA until the
selection of the most appropriate distribution for the demand data of each product
under study is defined, following Subsection 3.3. Table 5 display a summary of the
statistical results for 89 products of the inventory assortment of the Chilean food
service. This summary indicates, among other aspects, the statistical distribution
that fits the demand data best for each product.
   Third, once we have selected the most appropriate distribution to model the
demand data, we then use an adequate inventory management model to determine
the optimum level in stock to place an order of products, and the optimum ordered
quantity to minimize total inventory costs, following Subsection 3.4. Table 5 also
show the optimal quantity of replenishment and the ROP obtained by applying
the appropriate inventory management model.

   In Table 5, note that “P” and “EOQ” are the “inventory model” for the cor-
responding perishable and non-perishable product, respectively; “statistical distri-
bution” corresponds to the fitted demand distribution for the indicated product
according to the ID detailed in Table 12; λ and σ are the estimated demand mean
rate and SD given in (1) and (2); k0.95 is the SF for a service level of 95% given
below (2); “SS” is the safety stock given in (2); Q is the EOQ given in (1); CR and

d0 are given in (3); r is the ROP given in (2); and “JIT” is considered when this
method is used for such a product. Note also that the symbol “-” is used when the
corresponding value must not be calculated; “average” indicates that any distri-
bution can be fitted for such a product and then the normal distribution is used.
From Table 5, we describe 38 of the 89 products (components) from the inventory
assortment with the EOQ model given in (1), 47 with the perishable model given
in (3), and 4 with the JIT method, indicating that the total inventory is made up
of mostly perishable type products. BS distributions were adequate for several of
the demand data sets for those products allowing a distribution to be fitted (not
JIT).
    Fourth, once we have calculated the elements of the inventory models by using
equations (1) and (3), following the financial approach detailed in Subsection 3.5,
we compute the differences between direct and indirect costs (unit and annual),
with weekly and annual ordering, and obtain the differences between the CMs with
respect to the entire product inventory assortment of non-optimized and optimized
systems, by using equations (4) to (12). Table 6 shows the annual and weekly OCs
in both systems, where OCs for the optimized system increase 54.64%.

   Table 7 shows the annual SCs of the non-optimized and optimized systems,
which are diminished by 84.05%, translating our proposal into significant savings
due to the improvements obtained by using the inventory management models.

the non-optimized and optimized systems, for each of these financial indicators.
A positive value of the differential indicates savings detected for the indicated
product, using the optimized system. A negative value indicates the attained
optimization is unfavorable for the indicated product. In Table 11, the set of
critical products, which account for close to 80% of the optimized values obtained
in these financial indicators have been delimited by a line. This is established as a
cumulative percentage (CP) of optimized values regarding the total optimization
attained in the differential profit or saving of the financial indicator, using the
classification ABC; see details in Ramanathan (2006).


5. Illustration
    In this section, we illustrate the optimized analysis for one of the 89 products
in the inventory assortment of the case study presented in Section 4. We select
this product due to its statistical features, so that a practitioner can better under-
stand how the analysis is produced for a component, and thus replicated for other
components. This analysis is divided into three parts following Steps 2, 3 and 4
of Algorithm 1.


5.1. Statistical Analysis
    The data correspond to the demanded amount (D) of the ground beef product
(in kg) with ID = P42, which was collected during the period under study. Ta-
ble 8 displays a descriptive summary of the demand data that includes the sample
                                  ¯ SD, coefficients of variation (CV), skewness
median (50th percentile), mean (d),
or asymmetry (CS) and kurtosis (CK), and sample size (n), among other statis-
tics. This summary is obtained by the command descriptiveSummary() of the
gbs package. From Table 8, we note that the CS and CK for P42 data show a
distribution with positive skewness and moderate kurtosis.

                    Table 8: Descriptive measures for P42 data (in kg).
        n    Min      Med       d¯     SD         CV      CS    CK     Range    Max
        68   1.00     17.00   20.37   15.34     75.33%   1.08   3.43    64.00   65.00


    Figure 1 shows the histogram, boxplot and graph of the empirical CDF (ECDF)
for P42 data. These graphs are built with the command histgbs() of the gbs
package and boxplot() and ecdf() of the base R package. Note that: (i) the
histogram shows a PDF with positive skewness and moderately heavy tails; see
also Table 8; and (ii) the boxplot displays some outliers. Based on the EDA results,
BS distributions seem to be good options for modeling P42 data, because they can
accommodate their outliers and degrees of variability, skewness and kurtosis.
    BS, BS-t, gamma, IG, LN and Weibull parameters can be estimated using the
ML method; see Barros et al. (2009). For this purpose, commands mlegbs() and
gamlss() of the gbs and gamlss packages, respectively, can be used. The goodness
of fit of the model to P42 data can be checked using the AD and KS tests, which

                                              Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 1–30

compare the ECDF and the theoretical CDF assumed for the data (within BS,
BS-t, gamma, IG, LN and Weibull models). The command used for obtaining
these results is ksgbs() of the gbs package, and its corresponding adaptations to
the gamma, IG, LN and Weibull distributions. Table 9 provides the p-values of
the AD and KS tests for P42 data, from which we note that almost all of these
distributions seem to be reasonable models for these data. However, based on the
AD test results, which is more powerful than the KS test (Barros et al. 2014), only
the BS, BS-t and LN models fit the data well at a significance level of 1%.

are bands constructed by a simulation process facilitating the display setting. In
the case of BS distributions, these envelopes are built using the formulas given
in Subsection 3.3; see details in Leiva, Athayde, Azevedo & Marchant (2011) and
references therein. The commands used to obtain these graphs are envelopebs()
and envelopegbs() and their corresponding adaptations to the gamma, IG, LN
and Weibull distributions. From these graphs, we note the appropriate fitting
provided by BS, BS-t and LN distributions proposed for modeling P42 data, but
also the gamma and Weibull models (omitted here) are suitable, where all the
points are inside of their envelopes, therefore corroborating the results provided in
Table 9. However, as can be seen from the boxplot given Figure 1(center), there
are some outliers that can introduce an adverse effect on the ML estimates of the
parameters of the distributions detected as suitable by the goodness-of-fit methods.
Nevertheless, as mentioned, only the BS-t distribution has been proven to provide
estimates robust to these outliers. Thus, we choose the BS-t distribution as the
most suitable within the distributions proposed for describing P42 data.


5.2. Inventory Analysis
    Once we have selected the BS-t distribution as the most suitable to describe
the demanded quantity of P42, we use the perishable product model for single
period to determine the optimum quantity to be ordered for minimizing the total
cost of inventory. First, we estimate the demand rate from the BS-t distribution as
b = 23.19 kg/day. Then, with this value, we determine the optimum replenishment
λ
quantity as db0 = 15.45 kg, by using the formula given in (3), whose value must be
applied as refueling. We consider a constant LT of l = 3 days, which is the same
for all the products of the inventory assortment. Thus, at the beginning of each
week, the stock level must be checked, and then a quantity of (15.45 − Lj ) kg, for
j = 1, . . . , 27, of the product must be ordered.
    Note that, for the case of non-perishable products, once again we first estimate
the demand rate and, then, with this estimate, we calculate the optimum Q and
r using the formulas given in (1) and (2), respectively. Thus, when the stock level
is in r units, we generate an order of Q units of this type of product.


5.3. Financial Analysis
    Once we have chosen the appropriate inventory model for the P42 product,
we determine its CMs according to the expression given in (11). First, we obtain
the VCMs based on (8) following the definitions and the sequence of equations
given in (4)-(7). Second, we calculate the corresponding OC and SC using the
formulas displayed in (9) and (10), obtaining OC42,j = US$0.88 per order and
SC42,j = US$0.085 per stored unit of the P42 product. With this, we obtain
CM42 = −US$5242.72 (optimized value) in comparison to −US$5613.85 (non-
optimized value), reaching a reduction of 6.61% for this product. Table 10 provides
the weekly values of SQs, VCMs, OCs, SCs and CMs for the non-optimized and
optimized systems in the P42 product.

6. Concluding Remarks
    We proposed a methodology useful for food service companies that allows their
contribution margins to be optimized. The methodology was based on statisti-
cal tools, inventory management models and financial indicators. Its main steps
were synthesized in Algorithm 1. Because there is a need to conduct case stud-
ies focusing on their applicability in firms to reduce the gap between theory and
practice, and to transfer knowledge to the industry, we applied this methodology.
Specifically, the case study was conducted with a Chilean food service company,
which showed the importance of considering inventory models and statistical as-
pects for improving its supply and inventory policies, increasing its contribution
margins. Inventory management models for perishable products showed to adjust
adequately the demand for fruits and vegetables, which have the greatest unit


                                              Revista Colombiana de Estadística 38 (2015) 1–30

contribution margins, so that such products can be considered as critical in the
inventory assortment. With respect to the non-perishable products, it is note-
worthy that the EOQ model fitted them considerably well. Such products can
be stored indefinitely, without losses occurring until expiry, which has been used
to reduce ordering costs. Products fitted by the model for perishables presented
an optimized quantity similar to the demand rate, because such products have
a shelf life and cannot be stored for a long period. A small amount of prod-
ucts (about 5%) used a JIT method. In summary, we validated improvements
in logistics management applying an appropriate inventory model, increasing the
contribution margins of a Chilean company. This result agrees with that reported
by Ramanathan (2006), who linked inventory cost minimization and contribution
margin maximization with type A products in the ABC classification. These prod-
ucts correspond to around 20% the total of products in the inventory assortment
and are responsible for a proportion close to 80% of the total contribution mar-
gin. It is noteworthy that, although we attained an improvement of 10.47% in
contribution margin for the studied Chilean company, 1.8% in total variable con-
tribution margin, 54.64% in ordering costs, and 84.05% in storing costs, using the
proposed methodology, still some aspects can be improved. For example, it is pos-
sible to explore the statistical dependence among products. Seasonality and trend
factors, as well as dependence on the time of the demand, can be considered in
the modeling by using time series models. Statistical dependence among products
can be analyzed by means of multivariate structures for the models considered in
this work. In fact, the authors of the paper are planning to collect real-world data
of this type for a future study. In addition, from the practical standpoint, an-
other future study considering demand data for a menu instead of its components
is being considered by the authors. Studies of this type have been presented in
the literature under names such as: assemble to order systems, inventory models
with correlated demand, inventory models with multivariate demand, inventory
models with multi-item demand, inventory models with multi-component demand
and inventory models with component commonality, among others; see Agrawal
& Cohen (2001) and Lu & Song (2005). In any case, incorporating all of these
elements in the modeling can improve the precision of results, but can also increase
its statistical complexity, rendering its use less attractive to a practitioner. This
last aspect provides relevance to the present work.
