1. Introduction
    Warranties for durable consumer products are common in the market place.
Its primary role is to offer a post sale remedy for consumers when a product fails

to fulfill its intended performance during the warranty period and generally, they
also limit the manufacturer’s liability for out-of-warranty product failure.
    Manufacturers offer many types of warranties which have become an important
promotional tool for their products. A discussion about various issues related to
warranty policies can be found in Murthy (1990), Blischke   Murthy (1992a),
Blischke   Murthy (1992b), Blischke   Murthy (1992c), Mitra   Patankar (1993),
Blischke   Murthy (1994), Blischke   Murthy (1996).
   Although warranties are used by manufacturers as a competitive strategy to
boost their market share, profitability and image, they may cost a substantial
amount of money and, from a manufacturer’s perspective, the cost of a warranty
program should be analyzed and estimated accurately.
    A discounted warranty cost policy incorporates the time and provides an ad-
equate measure for warranties because, in general, warranty costs can be treated
as random cash flows in the future. Warranty issuers do not have to spend all
the money at the stage of warranty planning, instead, they can allocate it along
the life cycle of warranted products. Another reason why one should consider
the time value is for the purpose of determining the warranty reserve, a fund set
up specifically to meet future warranty claims. It is well known that the present
value of warranty liabilities or rebates to be paid in the future are less than the
face value and it is desirable to determine the warranty reserve according to the
present value of the total warranty liability. Related issues to discounted war-
ranty costs and warranty reserves have been studied by Mamer (1969), Mamer
(1987), Patankar   Mitra (1995) and Thomas (1989), from both manufacturer
and customer’s perspectives for single-component products, either repairable or
nonrepairable.
    More recently, Jain   Maheshwari (2006) proposed a hybrid warranty model for
renewing pro-rata warranties assuming constant failure rate and constant prod-
ucts maintenance and replacement costs. They derive the expected total dis-
counted warranty costs for different lifetime distributions and determine the op-
timal number and optimal period for preventive maintenance after the expiry of
the warranty; Jack   Murthy (2007) consider the costs for extended warranties
offered after a base warranty and investigate optimal pricing strategies and op-
timal maintenance/replacement strategies; Hong-Zhong, Zhie-Jie, Yanfeng, Yu  
Liping (2008) consider the cash flows of warranty reserve costs during the product
lifecycle and estimate the expected warranty cost for reparable and non repara-
ble products with both, the free replacement warranty and the pro-rata warranty
policy. They also consider the case where the item has a heterogeneous usage
intensity over the lifecicle and its usage is intermitent; Chattopadhyay   Rahman
(2008) study lifetime warranties where the warranty coverage period depends on
the lifetime of the product, they develop lifetime warranty policies and models
for predicting failures and estimating costs; Jung, Park   Park (2010) consider
optimal system maintenance policies during the post warranty period under the
renewing warranty policy with maintenance costs dependent on life cycle.
    In practice, most products are composed of several components. If warranties
are offered for each component separately, then warranty models for single-component

products can be applied directly. However, sometimes warranty terms are defined
upon an entire system. For such warranties, it is necessary to consider the system
structure as well as the component level warranty service cost (Thomas 1989).
Warranty analysis for multi-component systems based on the system structure
has been addressed in a few papers: Ritchken (1986) provides an example of a
two-component parallel system under a two-dimensional warranty; Chukova  
Dimitrov (1996) derive the expected warranty cost for two-component series sys-
tem and parallel system under a free-replacement warranty; Hussain   Murthy
(1998) also discuss warranty cost estimation for parallel systems under the setting
that uncertain quality of new products may be a concern for the design of war-
ranty programs; Bai   Pham (2006) obtained the first two centered moments of
the warranty cost of renewable full-services warranties for complex systems with
series-parallel and parallel-series structures. A Markovian approach to the analy-
sis of warranty cost for a three-component system can be found in Balachandran,
Maschmeyer   Livingstone (1981); Ja, Kulkarni, Mitra   Patankar (2002) study
the properties of the discounted warranty cost and total warranty program costs
for non renewable warranty policy with non stationary processes.
     There are many ways to model the impact of repair actions on system fail-
ure times. For complex systems, repair is often assumed to be minimal, which
restores its failure rate. For a review about modeling failure and maintenance
data from repairable systems, see Li   Shaked (2003) and Lindqvist (2006). For
a generalization of minimal repair to heterogeneous populations, i.e., when the
lifetime distribution is a mixture of distributions, see Finkelstein (2004). Nguyen
  Murthy (1984) present a general warranty cost model for single-component re-
pairable products considering as-good-as-new-repair, minimal repair and imperfect
repair, but the value of time is not addressed. In Ja et al. (2002), several warranty
reserve models for single-component products are derived for non stationary sale
processes. Ja, Kulkarni, Mitra   Patankar (2001) analyze a warranty cost model
on minimally repaired single-component systems with time dependent costs. Bai
  Pham (2004) consider the free-repair warranty and the pro-rata warranty poli-
cies to derive some properties of a discounted warranty cost for a series system
of repairable and independent components using a non homogeneous Poisson pro-
cess. Recently, Duchesne   Marri (2009) consider, the same problem by analyzing
some distributional properties (mean, variance, characteristic function) of the cor-
responding discounted warranty cost and using a general competing risk model
to approach system reliability; Sheu   Yu (2005) propose a repair-replacement
warranty policy which splits the warranty period into two intervals where only
minimal repair can be undertaken and a middle interval in which no more than
one replacement is allowed. Their model applies to products with bathtub failure
rate considering random minimal repair costs. Other work about repair strategies,
including imperfect and minimal repair, which consider their effects on warranty
costs, can be found in Yun, Murthy   Jack (2008), Chien (2008), Yeo   Yuan
(2009) and Samatliy-Pac   Taner (2009).
   For a series system with components which do not have common failures, sys-
tem failures coincide with component failures and warranty models for single-
component products can be applied directly. In this paper, we consider a dis-

                                    Revista Colombiana de Estadística 34 (2011) 513–543

counted warranty cost policy of a repairable coherent system under a minimal
repair process on its component level. In this case, the system is set up as a series
system with its components that survive to their critical levels, that is, the time
from which a failure of a component would lead to system failure and, therefore,
it is seen as a series system. We use the Martingale Central Limit Theorem to
approximate the warranty cost distribution for a fixed warranty period of length
w, and to estimate the warranty cost through the component failure/repair point
processes.
    In the Introduction of this paper we survey the recent developments in warranty
models. In Section 2, we consider the dependent components lifetimes, as they
appear in time through a filtration and use the martingale theory, a natural tool to
consider the stochastic dependence and the increasing information in time. In Sec-
tion 3, we consider independent copies of a coherent system, and its components,
as given in Section 2 and develop a statistical model for the discounted warranty
cost. Also, in this Section, we give an example. The paper is self contained but
a mathematical basis of stochastic processes applied to reliability theory can be
found in Aven   Jensen (1999). The extended proofs are in the Appendix.




2. The Warranty Discounted Cost Model of a
   Coherent System on its Component Level

   We consider the vector S = (S1 , S2 , . . . , Sm ) representing component lifetimes
of a coherent system, with lifetime T , which are positive random variables in
a complete probability space (Ω, F , P ). The components can be dependent but
simultaneous failures are ruled out, that is, for all i, j with i 6= j, P (Si = Sj ) = 0.
We observe the system on its component level throughout a filtration, a family of
sub σ-algebras of F , (Ft )t≥0

                     Ft = σ{1{T >s} , 1{Si >s} : s ≤ t, 1 ≤ i ≤ m},


   which is increasing, right-continuous and complete. Clearly, the Si , 1 ≤ i ≤ n
are (P, Ft )-stopping time.
    An extended and positive random variable τ is an (P, Ft )-stopping time if,
and only if, {τ ≤ t} ∈ ℑt , for all t ≥ 0; an (P, Ft )-stopping time τ is called
predictable if an increasing sequence (τn )n≥0 of (P, Ft )-stopping time, τn < τ ,
exists such that limn→∞ τn = τ ; an (P, Ft )-stopping time τ is totally inaccessible
if P (τ = σ < ∞) = 0 for all predictable (P, Ft )-stopping time σ.
    In what follows, to simplify the notation, we assume that relations such as
⊂, =, ≤, <, 6= between random variables and measurable sets, respectively, always
hold “P-almost surely”, i.e., with probability one, which means that the term P -
a.s., is suppressed.

2.1. Component Minimal Repair

     For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we consider the simple counting process Nti = 1{Si ≤t} ,
i.e., the counting process corresponding to the simple point process (Si,n )n≥1 with
Si = Si,1 and Si,n = ∞, for n ≥ 2. We use the Doob-Meyer decomposition

                 Nti = Ait + Mti ,          M i ∈ M20 ,      i = 1, . . . , m,                   (1)

where M20 represents the class of mean zero and square integrable (P, Ft )-martingales
which are right-continuous with left-hand limits. Ait is a unique nondecreasing right
continuous (P, Ft )-predictable process with Ai0 = 0, called the (P, Ft )-compensator
of Nti .
    We assume that the component lifetime Si , 1 ≤ i ≤ m is a totally inaccessible
(P, Ft )-stopping time, which is a sufficient condition for the absolutely continuity
of Ait . It follows that
                         Z t
                      i
                    At =     1{Si >s} λi (s)ds < ∞,   i = 1, . . . , m,           (2)
                            0


    where λi (t) is the (P, Ft )-failure rate of component i, a deterministic function
of t.
    Initially, consider the minimal repair process of component i. If we do a mini-
mal repair at each failure of component i, the corresponding minimal repair count-
                                                           e i = P 1{S ≤t} , with

                                                          M                                      (3)

                                     0

   Barlow and Proschan (1981) define the system lifetime T

                                  T = Φ(S) = min max Si
                                                    1≤j≤k i∈Kj

where Kj , 1 ≤ j ≤ k are minimal cut sets, that is, a minimal set of components
whose joint failure causes the system to fail. Aven   Jensen (1999) define the
critical level of component i as the (P, Ft )-stopping time Yi , 1 ≤ i ≤ m which
describes the time when component i becomes critical for the system, i.e., the
time from which the failure of component i leads to system failure. If either the
system or component i fail before the latter becomes critical (T ≤ Yi or Si ≤ Yi )
we assume that Yi = ∞. Therefore, as in Aven   Jensen (1999) we can write

                                           T = min Si                                            (5)
                                                  i:Yi <∞


     Therefore, concerning the system minimal repairs at the component level, it
is sufficient to consider the component minimal repairs after its critical levels. In
what follows we consider the set C i = {ω ∈ Ω : Si (ω) > Yi (ω)}, where Yi is the
critical level of component i, and the minimal repair point process restricted to
C i , that is, the process Nti∗ , defined as

                                           Nti∗ = 1C i Nti                                       (6)

    which counts the failures of component i when it is critical, implying system
failure.

process Nti = 1{Si ≤t} in C i is

2.2. Coherent System Minimal Repair

   Now we are going to define the minimal repair counting process and its corre-
sponding coherent system cost process.
   Let Nt = 1{T ≤t} be the system failure simple counting process and its (P, Ft )-
compensator process At , with decomposition

                                     Nt = At + Mt ,           M ∈ M20                                  (11)

and                                            Z t
                                      At =           1{T >s} λs ds < ∞                                 (12)
                                                0

   where the process (λt )t≥0 is the coherent system (P, Ft )-failure rate process.
   Since we do not have simultaneous failures the system will failure at time t
when the first critical component for the system at t− failures at t.
   Under the above conditions Arjas (1981) proves that the (P, Ft )-compensator
of Nt is
                                Xm h              i+
                           At =      Ait∧T − AiYi                          (13)
                                           i=1

    From compensator unicity, it becomes clear that the (P, Ft )-failure rate process
of system is given by

   If the system is minimally repaired on its component level, its (P, Ft )-failure
rate process λt is restored at its condition immediately before failure and therefore

Definition 1. For a fixed ω ∈ Ω let C Φ (ω) = {i ∈ {1, . . . , m} : Si (ω) > Yi (ω)}
be the set of components surviving its corresponding critical levels. For each

Note 3. Note that C i (ω) = 1 ⇔ ω ∈ C i and in each realization ω ∈ Ω, the indi-
cator variables C i (ω), i = 1, . . . , m, are constant in [0, t]. Therefore, if C i (ω) = 0,
then B bsi = 0, ∀ 0 ≤ s ≤ t. It means that in each realization of the system re-
pair/failure process, we only observe the repair/cost processes of components which
fail after their corresponding critical levels. Therefore, in each realization, the re-
pair/cost process for the system with structure Φ is equivalent to the repair/cost
process for a series system of components which are critical for the initial system
in such realization.



2.3. Martingale Estimator of the Warranty Cost

    In the following results and definitions, for each realization w, the minimal
repair costs of a coherent system is the sum of the minimal repair costs of its
critical components in a given realization ω.

3.2. The Central Limit Theorem
    In what follows we prove that the m-variate error process of the proposed
               i(n)

estimators, (B      − B i∗ (t), i = 1, . . . , m), conveniently standardized, satisfies the
               t
Martingale Central Limit Theorem, as in Karr (1986).

Theorem 3. (Karr 1986, Theorem 5.11). For fixed m and for each n, n ≥ 1, let
   i(n)
(Mt , i = 1, . . . , m) be a sequence of orthogonal, mean zero and square integrable
                                            i(n)       i(n)    i(n)−          i(n)−
martingales with jumps,at time t, ∆Mt             = Mt      − Mt     , where Mt     =
      i(n)

h↓0
function with Vi (0) = 0. If

                                                     n→∞


 (b) There is a sequence (cn )n≥1 , such that cn −−−−→ 0 and
                                                           n→∞


                               P (sup | △Msi(n) | ≤ cn ) −−−−→ 1                         (36)
                                    s≤t                           n→∞



   Then exist an m-variate Gaussian continuous process, M = (M i , i = 1, . . . , m)
where M i is a martingale with

                               hM i , M k it = 1{i=k} Vi (t)                             (37)

                                               D
such that M(n) = (M 1(n) , . . . , M m(n) ) −−−−→ M = (M 1 , . . . , M m ) in D[0, t]m
                                              n→∞

Note 5. In the above theorem the conditions (a) and (b) are sufficient to prove the
convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions and tightness of the sequence
M(n) in the m-dimensional space D[0, t]m of the right-continuous functions with
left limits, in [0, t] (Karr 1986).

    The confidence interval for B ∗ (w) given in (48) can have negative values and
it is not acceptable. We propose to build a confidence interval through a con-

venient bijective transformation g(x) such that dx   g(x) x=B ∗ (w) 6= 0, which does
not contain negative values. Conveniently, we consider g(x) = log x, x > 0 with
 d
dx g(x) = 1/x, x > 0.

    To illustrate the results we simulated the minimal repair warranty cost pro-
cess for a parallel system of three independent components with lifetimes Si ∼
Weibull(θi , βi ), i = 1, 2, 3, respectively, where θi is the scale parameter and βi is
                                                              i

Discounted Warranty Cost of a Minimally Repaired Coherent System                              531

                                                                         −δt
                                     −δt the first one is Hi (t) = Ci e
   We use two possible cost functions:                                       and the
                                  t
second one is Hi (t) = Ci 1 − w e , 0 ≤ t ≤ w, with δ = 1 in both cases.
Clearly they are bounded and continuous functions in [0, t]. The parameter values
are indicated in Table 1, w = 5 is the fixed warranty period and the sample sizes
are n = 30, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000.
   The critical levels of the components for the system under minimal repair are
                        
                        max Sj if max Sj < Si ,
                  Yi = j6=i             j6=i
                                                        i = 1, 2, 3             (57)
                        ∞          if max Sj ≥ Si ,
                                             j6=i


   Therefore, if the component failure times are observed in order S2 , S3 , S1 , then
T = max{S1 , S2 , S3 } = min Si = S1 , and, in this case, component 1, is the only
                           {Yi <∞}
one critical for the system. Therefore, after the second component failure time,
S3 , the system is reduced to component 1, which is minimally repaired in each
observed failure over the warranty period.

    The following results correspond to the Monte Carlo simulations in which we
got the mean cost for w = 5 and 1000 samples of size n = 100 and n = 200,
respectively. Table 4, presents several statistics and the Shapiro Wilk normality
test. In Figure 2, we show the histograms of mean costs.

   From results in Tables 2 to 4, and Figures 1 and 2, we observe that the mean
cost is approximately 1.85 for a warranty period of length w = 5. Also, the sample
variance and the 2.5th and 97.5th sample percentiles for the mean costs from
samples of size n = 100 showed in Table 4. They are close to the corresponding

                                   i=1
becomes clear that, in this case, the normal approximation is already achieved
with samples of size 100.

4. Conclusions
   A martingale estimator for the expected discounted warranty cost process of
a minimally repaired coherent system under its component level observation was
proposed. Its asymptotic properties were also presented using the Martingale
Central Limit Theorem.

grable (P, Ft )-martingale. From (63) and (64), we have

   Also, from the Strong Law of Large Numbers and continuity in t, we get

 (B s        − B i∗ (s)) −−−−→ 0,        ∀s ≤ t and therefore, sup |B s                 − B i∗ (s)| −−−−→ 0
                           n→∞                                           s≤t                              n→∞


then, we conclude

   Furthermore, we have

and taking limits in the above inequality, from (65) and (66) we get

and (58) is proved.


Appendix B. Proof of Proposition 2
    First, as the sequences (B  bti(j) , C i(j) , 1 ≤ j ≤ n) are independent and identically
distributed copies of (Bb i , C i ), we have that, for all t ≥ 0 and i = 1, . . . , m,
                         t

                          n                Z t                      

        i(n)
and B t        is an unbiased estimator for B i∗ (t).
                                                                                    i(n)
   Furthermore, from the Strong Law of Large Numbers, B t                                  converges almost
surely to B i∗ (t).

                              (n)
    Otherwise, as (Zt )n≥1 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed
random vectors and the components do not have simultaneous failures, the pro-
         i(n)      j(n)
cesses B t and B t      are uncorrelated in [0, t], for all i, j, i 6= j, all n and

             i(n)      j(n)            √    i(n) √  j(n)
  COV [Zt           , Zt      ] = COV [ n B t , n B t ] = COV [C i Bti , C j Btj ] = 0 (68)

     Consequently

                                   i(n)           √    i(n)
                       Var[Zt             ] = Var[ n B t ] = Var[C i Bti ] = σ 2i∗ (t)                  (69)

   Therefore, applying the Central Limit Theorem for a sequence of independent
and identically distributed random vectors with mean µ(t) = (B 1∗ (t), . . . , B m∗ (t))
and finite covariance matrix Σ(t), where Σij (t) = 1{i=j} σ 2i∗ (t), we obtain that
 (n)     D
Zt     −−−−→ Zt , where Zt is an m-variate Normal random vector with mean zero
       n→∞
and covariance matrix Σ(t). In what follows we prove the convergence of the
finite-dimensional distributions of the process Z(n) . For that we consider:

                                                              i(n)    j(n)
 (a) Since ∀ t ≥ 0, n ≥ 1, i 6= j, COV [Zt , Zt ] = COV [C i Bti , C j Btj ] = 0, we
                                              i(n)  j(n)
     have ∀ tk ≤ tl , tk , tl ∈ [0, t], COV [Ztk , Ztl ] = COV [C i Btik , C j Btjl ] = 0;

 (b) From the above, we can prove the convergence of the finite-dimensional dis-
     tributions of the process Z(n) using the Crámer-Wold procedure: proving
     the convergence for each component Z i(n) , for all 0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tk ≤ t,
     we prove that ∀ ail arbitrary constants,
                       m k−1
                       X X                                             m k−1
                                                                       X X
                                              i(n)    i(n)       D
                                     ail (Ztl+1 − Ztl ) −−−−→                    ail (Ztil+1 − Ztil )   (70)
                                                               n→∞
                           i=1 l=1                                     i=1 l=1

       which, using the Cramer-Wold procedure, is equivalent to

                                    (n)      (n)       (n)       D
                               (Zt1 , Zt2 , . . . , Ztk ) −−−−→ (Zt1 , Zt2 , . . . , Ztk )
                                                               n→∞


Now, for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m and t1 ≤ t2 ∈ [0, t], consider n independent and
identically distributed copies of (C i Bti1 , C i Bti2 ). Then, for each n and i = 1, . . . , m
                               i(n)    i(n)
we get the random vector (Zt1 , Zt2 ). Therefore

                                   i(n)      i(n)
                            E(Zt1 , Zt2 ) = (0, 0), ∀ n ≥ 1, i = 1, . . . , m.

                                                       i(j)    i(j)
Furthermore, since the copies C i(j) Bt1 Bt2 , j = 1, . . . , n are independent and
identically distributed and as, for independent copies j and k, the random variables
        i(j)           i(k)
C i(j) Bt1 and C i(k) Bt2 are also independent, we have

               i(n)         i(n)
      COV [Zt1 , Zt2 ] = E[C i Bti1 Bti2 ] − B i∗ (t1 )B i∗ (t2 ) = σ i∗ (t1 , t2 ) < ∞.                (71)

   From (69), Var[Zt1 ] = σ 2i∗ (t1 ) and Var[Zt2 ] = σ 2i∗ (t2 ). Then, from the
Central Limit Theorem for a sequence of independent and identically distributed
random vectors, with finite mean vector and finite covariance matrix, we have

                            i(n)      i(n)       D
                       (Zt1 , Zt2 ) −−−−→ (Zti1 , Zti2 ), ∀ t1 ≤ t2 ∈ [0, t]                              (72)

where (Zti1 , Zti2 ) is a bivariate normal vector with mean zero and covariance matrix

   Using an induction argument we can generalize the above result for all partition
0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tk ≤ t, of the interval [0, t] and we get for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m,

where (Zti1 , Zti2 , . . . , Ztik ) is a k-variate Normal vector with mean zero and finite

   Finally, we analyze Stone’s tightness condition in D[0, t]m (Fleming   Harrington

Appendix C. Proof of Theorem 4
                                                  (n)
   From Theorem 2 we have E[Et ] = 0 for all n ≥ 1 and t ≥ 0.
        (n)  √ b (n)     (n)      (n)    √     (n)
   Let Mt = n(B   t  − Bt ) and Zt = n(Bt − µ(t)). Note that

                             (n)       √    (n)
                                                           (n)  (n)
                           Et      =      b
                                        n(B     − µ(t)) = Mt + Zt                                (77)
                                            t

   Now, for all t ≥ 0 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m we are going to calculate the asymptotic
                            i(n)    √ b i(n)                i(n)   i(n)
variance for the processes Et    = n(B  t    − B i∗ (t)) = Mt + Zt . For fixed
t,
                 i(n)          i(n)        i(n)              i(n) i(n)
           Var[Et ] = Var[Mt ] + Var[Zt ] + 2 COV [Mt , Zt ]              (78)

   Since the copies are independent and identically distributed, from Corollary 3
                                            i(n)
and for all t ≥ 0, we have that Var[Mt ] corresponds to
                      h1 Xn         Z t                   i
  E[hM  i(n)
             it ] = E        C i(j)                                 b i − B i )2 ] = V ∗ (t);
                                           Hi2 (s)λi (s)ds = E[C i (B t    t          i
                       n j=1         Yi
                                       (j)


                                                                                                 (79)
           i(n)
and Var[Zt        ] is given by (69).
                                                 i(n)       i(n)
     In order to calculate COV [Mt , Zt ], we use the covariance definition, the
                                                                          b i(j) and
martingale property, the fact that for independent copies j and l, C i(j) B t
        i(l)
C i(l) Bt are also independent, concluding
                                   i(n)       i(n)             b i B i ] − E[C i (B i )2 ]
                         COV [Mt          , Zt       ] = E[C i B t t               t             (80)

Therefore, from (69), (79) and (80), we obtain in (78) that, for all n ≥ 1 and t ≥ 0
                                       i(n)              bti )2 ] − (B i∗ (t))2
                             Var[Et           ] = E[C i (B

                             b i ] = B i∗ (t) and then,
   In addition,we have E[C i B t

                                           i(n)               b i ] = δ 2i∗ (t)
                                Var[Et            ] = Var[C i B t                                (81)

                                          i(n)       j(n)
    We also calculate COV [Et , Et ] for n ≥ 1 and i 6= j, and since processes
        btj do not have simultaneous jumps, we obtain,
bti and B
B
                                   i(n)          j(n)                          btj ] = 0
                                                                     bti , C j B
                         COV [Et          , Et          ] = COV [C i B                           (82)

   From results (81) and (82) we conclude that the asymptotic covariance for the
         (n)
process Et is U(t) where Uij (t) = 1{i=j} δ 2i∗ (t). Next, we set the asymptotic
                   (n)
normality of Et by considering the results from its asymptotic covariance struc-
                                                           (n)

    As the processes M(n) and Z(n) satisfy the tightness condition in D[0, t]m and
their finite-dimensional distributions converge to Gaussian continuous processes,
                                    i(n)  j(n)
such that ∀ tk , tl ∈ [0, t], COV [Etk , Etl ] = 0, the process E(n) = M(n) + Z(n)
also satisfies the tightness condition.
    Also, its finite-dimensional distributions converge to Gaussian continuous pro-
cesses and for all partition 0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tk ≤ t, we can prove that,
