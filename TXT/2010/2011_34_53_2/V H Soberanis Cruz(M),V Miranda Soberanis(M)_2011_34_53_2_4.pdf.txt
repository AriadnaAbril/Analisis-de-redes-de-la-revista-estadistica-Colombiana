Universidad de Quintana Roo, Quintana Roo, México
Abstract
The randomized response technique (RR), introduced by Warner (1965) was designed to avoid non-answers to questions about sensitive issues and protect the privacy of the interviewee. Some other randomized response techniques have been developed as the Mortons technique which was developed based on a finite population sampling without replacement. In this paper we are presenting an estimation of the population (total of individuals N ) based on Mortons technique assisted for a logistic regression model and considering a specific sensitive characteristic A, with an auxiliary variable associated to the sensitive variable. Analyses were conducted assuming finite population sampling and based on the p-estimators theory through a model assisted estimator. In addition, we propose an estimator of the variance of the estimator, as well as the results of simulations showing that the model as sisted estimator of the variance decreases compared with an estimator which depends of the sampling design.
Key words: Model assisted inference, Randomized response, Sampling design, Sensitive question.
Resumen
La técnica de respuesta aleatorizada (RA) introducida por Warner (1965), fue diseñada para disminuir la no-respuesta sobre aspectos sensibles y para proteger la confidencialidad del entrevistado en muestreos con reemplazo. Otras técnicas RA para muestreos sin reemplazo en poblaciones finitas, como la de Morton, han sido desarrolladas y comparadas. En este trabajo se exponen los resultados de la estimación del total de individuos de una población finita con la técnica de Morton, considerando una característica específica sensitiva A en un muestreo sin reemplazo y asistido por un modelo de regresión logística, con una variable auxiliar asociada a la variable sensitiva. Se desarrolla en el contexto de poblaciones finitas y en el marco de la teoría de los estimadores-π, a través de un estimador asistido por el modelo. Asimismo, se propone un estimador para la varianza del estimador y se muestra, vía simulación, que este estimador para la varianza disminuye, comparado con otro estimador que depende únicamente del diseño de muestreo.
Palabras clave: diseño de muestreo, inferencia asistida por modelo, pregunta sensitiva, respuesta aleatorizada.

1. Introduction
    Surveys represent procedures used by researchers to obtain information about a
sample of individuals. Sometimes surveys include one or more questions related to
personal information that could be considered as “private” and cause the individual
to feel at risk (Méndez, Eslava & Romero 2004), and therefore, the individual
refuses to participate or provides untrue responses.
    When interviewers try to obtain honest responses, in studies where some sen-
sitive issues, such as drug use, tax evasion, or sexual preferences, through survey
sampling, they may face difficulties that intrinsically belong to the interviewee: at-
titude, time available, a different way of thinking, among others. (Sánchez 1985).
    Strategies to minimize resistance from the interviewee to provide the real re-
sponse, when the topic might represent an invasion of privacy are classified into
two types. The first strategy is based on the phrasing of the questions that contain
the characteristic that wants to be measure in such a way that indirect questions
are used to obtain the real response. The second strategy refers to the method
of randomized response (RR), introduced by Warner (1965). The RR is a spe-
cially designed method to ensure the privacy of the interviewee when sensitive,
delicate, or embarrassing topics are studied. With these two strategies, the re-
searcher avoids that the behavior of those surveyed gets skewed toward socially
desirable responses. In this regard, real responses are obtained about sensitive
issues (true/false) while assuring the confidentiality of the responses. In other
words, the interviewer will not know the real answer.
    Warner (1965) developed a technique called Randomized Response that guar-
antees the anonymity of the interviewee. It consists of a random mechanism that
selects one of two complementary questions, as follows: Question (1): “do you have
a specific characteristic A?” whereas Question (2) is “do you have the complemen-
tary characteristic?” where A represents the sensitive characteristic of interest
and, the absence of such characteristic (Estevao, Hidiroglou & Sarndal 1999). The
interviewee will provide the answer (yes or no), however, the interviewer will not
know which question is answered. In this way, the anonymity of the interviewee is
protected. This technique is also known as the Complementary Question Model.
  As an alternative to Warner’s Model of Complementary Questions Greenberg,
Abul-Ela & Horvitz (1969) proposed a Model of Randomized Responses that con-

tain two unrelated questions. One question addresses the sensitive issue of in-
terest and the second one is innocuous. In other words, the second question is
non-sensitive.
    Horvitz, Greenberg & Abernathy (1976) attributed to R. Morton the idea about
the Randomized Response Technique in which the random selection of unrelated
questions are made among three options: (1) the sensitive question itself, (2) an
instruction that indicates “yes”, and (3) an instruction that indicates “no”, that can
be chosen with their respective probabilities P1 ,P2 ,P3 , where P1 + P2 + P3 = 1.
In this paper, we will call this model MU (Morton Unrelated), in allusion to R.
Morton who had the original idea.
    In order to understand the objective of this paper, we will consider a finite
population of N units with a sensitive characteristic yk , (k = 1, 2, . . . , N ) in which
the total, Ty = y1 + y2 + · · · + yN wants to be estimated. The main objective
of this paper is to obtain better estimations of Ty (Soberanis, Ramírez, Pérez &
González 2008) through Sampling without Replacement and the design of Morton
Unrelated (MU), exploring estimators assisted by the Generalized Logistic Regres-
sion Estimator (GLRE) proposed by Lehtonen & Veijanen (1998a). In addition,
the standard deviations of the estimators will be compared through simulation and
recommendations will be provided. Thus, in this paper, an estimator of Ty will be
proposed using a super population model: The Model of Logistic Regression.


2. The Generalized Logistic Regression Model
   Let U = 1, . . . , k, . . . , N be a finite population of participants. The subset
A ⊂ U is defined by a sensitive characteristic A; therefore, the RR technique is
used to protect the anonymityP      of the sample of individuals (Soberanis et al. 2008).
We will estimate TA =            yk where yk = 1 if k ∈ A, and yk = 0 if k ∈  / A. The
                           U
selection of sample S is conducted under the sampling design p(s) with positive
inclusion probabilities πk and πkl , where
                             X                                X
          πk = P r(S ∋ k) =     p(s) y πkl = P r(S ∋ k & l) =     p(s)
                               S∋k                                    S∋ k & l


    The estimator GLRE is generated with the predicted values obtained through
                                              P Hidiroglou & Sarndal 1995): We
the adjustment of the following model (Estevao,
need to estimate the total population T = U yk . A sample S is obtained as-
signing to unit k the sampling weight ak = π1k . x represents an auxiliary vector
of dimension J ≥ 1, and xk represents the a priori value for unit k ∈ U . In
this method, data {(yk , xk ) : k ∈ s} are observed. For those units that are not
included in the sample, y − k is unknown but it is possible to obtain a value µk
that approximates yk for all population units even though the approximation is
not the most precise. Now, let
                                  X        X
                            TA =      µk +    (yk − µk )
                                     U           U

                P                                                    P
where the sum U µk is the dominante term and the residual sum U (yk − µk ),
even though it is small, it needs to be estimated. Let us assume that xk is situated
in the sampling frame for all k ∈ s. The predicted values ybk are obtained from
the supplementary information adjusting a model in such a way that Eξ (Yk |
xk ; β) = µ(xk | β), where Eξ is the expectation operator under the theoretical
model ξ, µ(xk | β). In addition ξ, µ(xk | β) is a specific function, and β is an
unknown vector of parameters in the model. The function of model ξ is to describe
the elements in the population in a “reasonable” way as if they would have been
generated by the model itself.
    However, it is not expected that the population was generated by the model ξ,
therefore, conclusions about population parameters, including TbA , are independent
from assumptions underlying the model.
    In this manner, using the data from sampling{(yk , xk : k ∈ s}, β b is obtained
as the maximum likelihood pseudo-estimator (MLEP) of β, as it includes the
sampling weights. In addition, the predicted values ybk = µ(xk | β)    b = µ bk are
                                            b and the Horvitz-Thompson estimator
calculated, for each k ∈ U . Further, using µ
(HT) for the residual sum, we obtain:

                       TbLGREG =       bk +

                                      U           s

   Equation (1) is the GLRE from Lehtonen & Veijanen (1998a).
                                               b in order to use it in the estimation
   In practice, model ξ works as a way to find β,
functions.


2.1. The LGREG for Model MU
    The Generalized Logistic Regression Estimator TbA,LGREG for TbA , proposed
previously, is an application of the Lehtonen & Veijanen (1998a), which, as we
have mentioned before, is an estimator assisted for a Logistic Regression Model.
In other words, for y = (y1 , . . . , yk , . . . , yN )t , the following model is suggested:
                                                 t
                                               exk β
                    P r{Yk = 1 | xk ; β} =            t   , k = 1, 2, . . . , N         (2)
                                             1 + exk β
   From now on, this super population model will be referred as model ξ. In
addition, for Morton’s (MU) Random Mechanism (RR), it is defined:
                        
                         yk with probability P1
                   Zk =   1 with probability P2                          (3)
                        
                          0 with probability 1 − P1 − P2
k = 1, 2, . . . , N . Thus,
                              E(Zk ) =       Eξ ERC (Zk )
                                     =       Eξ [P1 yk + P2 ]
                                                                                        (4)
                                     =       P1 Eξ (yk ) + P2
                                     =       P1 µk + P2

   Therefore, if λk = E(Zk ) = P r{Zk = 1 | xk ; β}, we obtain:

where β represents the population parameter defined for the likelihood equation:

                                    ∂ log L(β)/∂β = 0

which is equivalent to the following equation
                             Xh               i
                                 yk − µ xtk B xk = 0

   For practical purposes, we will use either β or B.

as if (Zk , xk ) was observed for each k ∈ U , as in a census. Thus,
                     l(β | z) =           ln L(β | z)
                                          Xh                                     i

    It should be noted that the function l(B | z) reaches a maximum in B, and is
defined and characterized by the following equation:
                        "                                                            #

                 =0

      Thus, B is defined implicitly as the one parameter that maximizes l(B | Z).
      Also, the estimator π of l(B | z) is given by:
                                X     h                                 i

      Where λk is given by (6).
      In addition,

    Base on the π estimators theory (Sarndal, Swensson & Wretman 1992, Wret-
man, Sarndal & Cassel 1977, Lehtonen & Veijanen 1998a), the following estimator
is proposed for V ar(TbA,LGREG ):
                                  !                     !           !

3. An Estimator that only Depends on the Sampling
   Design
   Based on Morton’s random response technique and a sampling design p(s), a
π-estimador for tA , is given by Soberanis et al. (2008):

                             TbA,π =            −                       (13)

                                                       S

      Its variance is given by
                                         (                                             )

7. Discussion and Conclusions
7.1. Discussion
   This paper focuses on the use of auxiliary variables as well as on models for the
random response sampling (RR) in finite populations, i.e. in populations where all

                                              Revista Colombiana de Estadística 34 (2011) 451–460

Generalized Logistic Regression Estimator for Morton’s RR                             459

observation units are identifiable. Furthermore, the sampling designs used were
sampling designs with no replacement due to the sensitivity of the variable of
interest.
    The proposal is based on the work of Lehtonen & Veijanen (1998a), Lehtonen
& Veijanen (1998b), Estevao et al. (1999), which was developed for sampling in
finite populations. In other words, for a type of sampling where the researcher is
focused on exhaustive data collection until the process to delimit and define the
fundamental variables occurs constantly (Pandit 1996, Goulding 2002).
    The use of auxiliary variables in a conventional way, i.e. when the variable of
interest is correlated with the auxiliary variable in the context of RR, does not
necessarily improve the Simple Random Sampling, at least for the Rao-Hartley-
Cochran scheme. This happens because the auxiliary information is not used
properly, as the variable of interest is a discrete variable. In fact, the proper use of
the variable of interest is through a model that assists in the problem of estimating
the population total, hence the use of the Generalized Logistic Regression Model.


7.2. Conclusions
    If the logistic regression model describes the population adequately, then the
estimators GLRE and MU should be used. The results suggest that by using
this method, we will obtain a significant reduction in the estimator’s variance. It
should be noted that it is not necessary that the model is “true”, as it represents a
process in which the population being studied is generated. However, additional
simulations under different conditions should be done in order to compare them
to the results obtained in this paper. Only then specific recommendations on the
most appropriate approach can be provided.
