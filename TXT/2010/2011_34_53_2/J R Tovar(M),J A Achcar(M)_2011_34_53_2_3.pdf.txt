Abstract
In many practical situations, clinical diagnostic procedures include two or more biological traits whose outcomes are expressed on a continuous scale and are then dichotomized using a cut point. As measurements are performed on the same individual there is a likely correlation between the continuous underlying traits that can go unnoticed when the parameter estimation is done with the resulting binary variables. In this paper, we compare the performance of two different indexes developed to evaluate the dependence between diagnostic clinical tests that assume binary structure in the results with the performance of the binary covariance and two copula dependence parameters.
Key words: Copula, Farlie Gumbel Morgenstern distribution, Gumbel distribution.
Resumen
Muchos procedimientos de diagnóstico clínico médico exigen la evaluación de dos o mas rasgos biológicos que se ven alterados ante la presencia de fenómenos de enfermedad o infección, los cuales se expresan en una escala contínua de medición con posterior dicotomización usando de un valor límite o punto de corte. Dado que las mediciones son realizadas en el mismo indivíduo, los resultados probablemente presenten dependencia de algún tipo, lo cual puede ser ignorado en la etapa de análisis de datos dada la presentación binaria de los datos. En este estudio comparamos el comportamiento de dos parámetros de dependencia presentes en funciones de cópula con el de la covarianza binaria y dos índices creados para medir dependencia entre pruebas diagnósticas de respuesta dicótoma.

1. Introduction
    The study of dependence between two clinical diagnostic tests has been a mat-
ter of interest in medical and statistical research. Many studies developed within
clinical diagnostic tests framework have studied the conditional dependence be-
tween diagnostic tests using the binary covariance as dependence parameter (see
for instance: (Thibodeau 1981), (Vacek 1985), (Torrance-Rynard & Walter 1997),
(Enoe, Georgiadis & Johnson 2000) and (Dendukuri & Joseph 2001) among many
others). Some authors as Georgiadis, Johnson & Gardner (2003), have used
reparametrizations of the conditional correlation between binary tests to facilitate
the prior specification in the implementation of a Bayesian estimation procedure.
Bohning & Patilea (2008), consider one of the indexes used by Georgiadis et al.
(2003) and developed another one to study the association between two diagnostic
tests in designs where the individuals with negative outcome in both screening
tests are not verified by “gold standard” (verification bias conditions).
    Many diagnostic procedures include the measures of two or more biological
traits directly observable or not, whose outcomes are initially expressed on a con-
tinuous scale and operationalized within a dichotomous representation using a
cut point. It is possible that, there exists dependence between the two evaluated
traits conditional on the true disease state and the same should be studied us-
ing indexes developed to study association between continuous variables, but as
the data analyses is made with the binary data, the data analyst evaluates the
conditional dependence hypothesis using indexes developed to binary variables.
   In this paper, we use the indexes developed by Bohning & Patilea (2008) and
we compare their performance with the performance of the binary covariance and
the performance of the Farlie Gumbel Morgerstern (FGM) and Gumbel copula de-
pendence parameters. The main goal is to evaluate the existing relationship among
the five dependence parameters, where three of them (covariance and Böhning’s
indexes) are built to study dependence between binary variables and the other
two (copula parameters) are developed to model dependence between continuous
variables.
   The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce the estimation
model formulation for two associated diagnostic tests, in Section 3, we present the
comparative study among Böhning and Patilea’s indexes, the binary covariance
and the copula dependence parameters, in Section 4, we introduce two examples,
one of them with simulated data and the other with published data. Finally, in
Section 5, we present some conclusions on the results obtained.


2. Statistical Model with Two Dependent Screening
   Tests
    Let us assume that we have a clinical diagnostic procedure that uses two screen-
ing tests whose performance we are interested to study and a reference procedure
that classifies individuals as diseased and non-diseased without error called “gold

standard”. Sometimes, the design of the study considers that those individuals
with negative outcomes in both screening tests are not verified by the “gold stan-
dard” which is known as “verification bias”. We assume that, the screening test
outcomes are expressed on a continuous scale and they are exposed to a process
of dichotomization using a cut point. We also assume that the test outcomes have
a continuous dependent structure but the same can not be considered in the data
analysis since they are presented in a binary form.


2.1. Modelling Dependence with Binary Structure
    Let us denote by p the prevalence of a disease and by D a random variable
related to the true disease status, where D = 1 denotes a diseased individual and
D = 0 denotes a non-diseased individual. That is, p = P (D = 1). Also, denote by
T1 and T2 , the two random variables associated to the test results, where Tj = 1,
denotes a positive result and Tj = 0, denotes a negative result, P (Tj = 1 | D =
1) = Sj is the sensitivity of the test j and P (Tj = 0 | D = 0) = Ej is the specificity
of the test j, for j = 1, 2. If we assume that, the dependence between tests can
be modeled by the covariance (ψ parameter) using a Bernoulli distribution on the
test outcome and we also assume the covariance is not necessarily the same in
both populations (ψD 6= ψN D ), we can use the Dendukuri’s procedure to obtain
the likelihood function contributions, as shown in Table 1.

         D assuming binary dependence structure (Values in brackets are unknown

2.2. Modelling Dependence using Copula Functions
   Let us assume that the test outcomes are realizations of the random variables
V1 and V2 measured in a positive continuous scale, that is, V1 > 0 and V2 > 0.
Also, let us assume that two cut-off values ξ1 and ξ2 are chosen for each test in
order to determine when an individual is classified as positive or negative. In this
way we assume that an individual is classified as positive for test ν if Vν > ξν

that is, Tν = 1 if and only if Vν > ξν for ν = 1, 2. To measure the degree of the
dependence structure between the random variables V1 and V2 , let us consider the
use of copula functions (For details about this topic, (Nelsen 1999) is a good refer-
ence). For specified univariate marginal distribution functions F1 (v1 ), . . . , Fm (vm ),
the function C(F1 (v1 ), . . . , Fm (vm )) which is defined using a copula function C,
results in a multivariate distribution function with univariate marginal distribu-
tions specified as F1 (v1 ), . . . , Fm (vm ). Any multivariate distribution function F
can be written in the form of a copula function, that is, if F (v1 , . . . , vm ) is a joint
multivariate distribution function with univariate marginal distribution functions
F1 (v1 ), . . . , Fm (vm ), thus there exists a copula function C(u1 , . . . , um ) such that,
F (v1 , . . . , vm ) = C(F1 (v1 ), . . . , Fm (vm )). For the special case of bivariate distri-
butions, we have m = 2. The approach to formulate a multivariate distribution
using a copula is based on the idea that a simple transformation can be made
of each marginal variable in such a way that each transformed marginal variable
has an uniform distribution. Once this is done, the dependence structure can be
expressed as a multivariate distribution on the obtained uniforms and a copula
is precisely a multivariate distribution on marginally uniform random variables.
In this way, there are many families of copulas which differ in the detail of the
dependence they represent. In the bivariate case, let V1 and V2 be two random
variables with continuous distribution functions F1 and F2 . The probability inte-
gral transformation is applied separately for the two random variables to define
U = F1 (V1 ) and W = F2 (V2 ) where U and W have uniform (0, 1) distributions,
but are usually dependent if V1 and V2 are dependent (V1 and V2 independent im-
plies that U and W are independent). Specifying dependence between V1 and V2 is
the same as specifying dependence between U and W , thus the problem reduces to
specifying a bivariate distribution between two uniform variables, that is a copula.
In this paper, we use two copula functions to study the dependence between two
diagnostic tests namely: the Farlie Gumbel Morgerstern (FGM) copula and the
Gumbel copula.
    The FGM copula is defined by,

                           C(u, w) = uw[1 + ϕ(1 − u)(1 − w)]                                (1)

where u = F1 (v1 ), w = F2 (v2 ) and −1 ≤ ϕ ≤ 1. As, ϕ measures the dependence
between the two marginals, then, if ϕ = 0, we have independent random variables.
We assume two dependence parameters ϕD and ϕN D with the same value for
diseased and non-diseased individuals, respectively. From (1), the cumulative joint
distribution and the joint survival distribution functions for the random variables
V1 and V2 conditional on the diseased status (D subscript and superscript) are
given respectively by,

  F (v1 , v2 ) = C(F1 (v1 ), F2 (v2 )) = F1 (v1 )F2 (v2 )
                                                      [1 + ϕ(1 − F1 (v1 ))(1 − F2 (v2 ))]   (2)



         S(v1 , v2 ) = P (V1 > v1 , V2 > v2 ) = 1 − F1 (v1 ) − F2 (v2 ) + F (v1 , v2 )      (3)

Dependence between Diagnostic Tests                                                      437

   To obtain the likelihood function contributions within the diseased individuals
group we have;

       P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1 | D = 1) = P (V1 > ξ1 , V2 > ξ2 | D = 1) = SD (ξ1 , ξ2 ),

                    P (T1 = 1 | D = 1) = P (V1 > ξ1 | D = 1) = S1 ,
                    P (T2 = 1 | D = 1) = P (V2 > ξ2 | D = 1) = S2 ,
                        F1D (ξ1 ) = P (V1 ≤ ξ1 | D = 1) = 1 − S1 ,
and
                        F2D (ξ2 ) = P (V2 ≤ ξ2 | D = 1) = 1 − S2

   Using (2) we get,

            FD (ξ1 , ξ2 ) = F1D (ξ1 )F2D (ξ2 )[1 + ϕ(1 − F1D (ξ1 ))(1 − F2D (ξ2 ))]
                        = (1 − S1 )(1 − S2 )(1 + ϕD S1 S2 )

and,

  P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1 | D = 1) = SD (ξ1 , ξ2 ) = 1 − (1 − S1 ) − (1 − S2 )+
                                                         (1 − S1 )(1 − S2 )(1 + ϕD S1 S2 )

   That is,

              P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1|D = 1) = S1 S2 (1 + ϕD (1 − S1 )(1 − S2 ))               (4)

and
            P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1, D = 1) = pS1 S2 (1 + ϕD (1 − S1 )(1 − S2 ))               (5)

   Similarly, we get all likelihood contributions with diseased and non-diseased
individuals (see Table 2).
   The Gumbel copula, developed by Gumbel (1960) is defined as,

         C(u, w) = u + w − 1 + (1 − u)(1 − w) exp{−φ ln(1 − u) ln(1 − w)}                (6)

   In this model, the joint cumulative distribution function for the random vari-
ables V1 and V2 is given by,

  F (v1 , v2 ) = F1 (v1 ) + F2 (v2 ) − 1+
                (1 − F1 (v1 ))(1 − F2 (v2 )) exp{−φ ln(1 − F1 (v1 )) ln(1 − F2 (v2 ))}   (7)

   The dependence parameter of the Gumbel copula does not model positive linear
correlations and when the two variables are independents, we have φ = 0.
   Employing the same arguments considered in the FGM copula to find the joint
probabilities of all combinations with D, T1 and T2 and using (7) we obtain all the
contributions for the likelihood function using the Gumbel copula (See Table 2).

3. Indexes Developed by Böhning and Patilea
    Bohning & Patilea (2008), developed two association indexes to study the case
of two dependent diagnostic tests in situations where it is not possible to verify the
true disease status in individuals with negative outcome in both screening tests.
The authors proposed computation of the indexes using the observed probabilities
in the likelihood function. The Böhning and Patilea’s indexes θi and αi (i = D
denotes diseased individuals and i = N D denotes non-diseased individuals) are
defined as:
                      P (T1 = 1 | T2 = 1, D = i)
                 θi =
                          P (T1 = 1, D = i)
                                                                                               (8)
                           P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1, D = i)
                    =                                               θi ∈ (0, ∞)
                      P (T1 = 1, D = i)P (T2 = 1, D = i)

   If θi = 1 the tests results are independent; if θi < 1 there is negative association
between tests and if θi > 1, the association between tests is positive.


              P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1, D = i)P (T1 = 0, T2 = 0, D = i)
       αi =                                                      αi ∈ (0, ∞)                   (9)
              P (T1 = 1, T2 = 0, D = i)P (T1 = 0, T2 = 1, D = i)

   Thus, αi is defined as the odds ratio in the ith diseased state, and when αi = 1
we have independence between tests; negative dependence is expressed by αi < 1
and positive dependence by αi > 1.
    In spite of the fact that, both indexes measure dependence and they are within
of the same range of values, they are different in nature. To establish the re-
lationship between them, the authors considered a reparametrization given by:
ai = θi P (T1 = 1 | D = i) = P (T1 = 1 | T2 = 1, D = i), bi = θi P (T2 = 1 | D =
i) = P (T2 = 1 | T1 = 1, D = i) and ηi = θ1i .
   Let us rewrite the cell probabilities in the cross-tabulation as:

                             P (T1 = 1, T2 = 1, D = i) = ηai bi ,

Dependence between Diagnostic Tests                                                     439

                           P (T1 = 0, T2 = 1 = ηai (1 − bi )),

                        P (T1 = 1, T2 = 0, D = i) = η(1 − ai )bi
and
                 P (T1 = 0, T2 = 0, D = i) = η(1 − ai )(1 − bi ) + 1 − η

      In this way, the αi parameter can be expressed in terms of the parameter ηi ,
by,
                                                  1 − ηi
                              αi = 1 +                                                 (10)
                                           ηi (1 − ai )(1 − bi )

    The BP indexes were developed assuming that the tests have the same depen-
dence within the disease and non-disease populations (θD = θN D and αD =
αN D ) and they are useful when the design of the study does not include the ver-
ification with “gold standard” of those individuals with negative outcome in both
screening tests. So, using the θ index, we can to estimate the unknown quantities
of disease and non-disease individuals,

                 nD = a + b + c + [d] and nN D = e + f + g + [h]

as follows:
                                                          

                                         (e + 1)

   On the other hand, with the α index we can to estimate the unknown quantities
d and h, as follows:

   Assuming the three dependence structures for the two diagnostic tests, using
the results showed in Tables 2 and 3 and the equations (8), (9), we obtained the
analytic relationship between θi and αi with ψi ϕi and φi .

Dependence between Diagnostic Tests                                                  441

    In all cases, the Böhning and Patilea’s association indexes (BP indexes) are
functions of the performance characteristics of the tests, and when the performance
parameters are going to one or zero, the BP indexes could go to infinity or to be
indeterminate. We have in Table 3, the limit values of the BP indexes when the
test parameters are going to zero or one and the dependence coefficients are fixed
at their extreme values.

Table 3: Limits of θ and α indexes when the performance test parameters (PTP), are
         going to zero or one and ψi = ±1, ϕi = ±1 and φi = 1. (for diseased
         individuals, PTP are S1 and S2 ; for non-diseased individuals, PTP are E1
         and E2 )

   The relationship between covariance and copula parameters is not shown in
Table 3, given that the covariance has zero as limit value in all combinations of
extreme values made with the copula parameters and performance test parameters.
   Observe that, under the hypothetical situation where we have two binary tests
with the same perfect association within each individuals group (ψD = −1 and
ψN D = −1 or ψD = 1 and ψN D = 1) if the tests have perfect negative association,
we need for both tests to have absolutely perfect sensitivities (S1 = S2 = 1) and
absolutely imperfect specificities (E1 = E2 = 0), to model association using θi ;
otherwise, we can not use it. If the tests have perfect positive association, we can
model associations with θi values belonging to the interval [2, ∞) provided that
the performance parameters belong to the interval (0, 1). In this way, values of θi
very close to 2, will be related with ψi values close of zero.
     On the other hand, if we have two tests, whose perfectly negative or positive
dependence structure can be modeled using the FGM copula, we only can have
agreement between the copula parameter and the BP indexes, when both sen-
sitivities are equal to zero and both specificities are equal to one; then, under
those conditions, we can only model associations when θi belongs to the interval
[0, 2]. When the test parameters take values inside the within (0, 1), the θi param-

eter would be indicating independence between tests while the FGM is indicating
strong dependence between them.
    For the Gumbel copula, we evaluated the extreme value 1 because this model
is only applicable for positive dependence and 0 indicates independence. When
the Gumbel dependence parameter indicates perfect positive dependence between
two tests, both with absolutely imperfect sensitivities S1 = S2 = 0 or both with
absolutely perfect specificities E1 = E2 = 1, the θi index takes the zero value indi-
cating perfect negative association. When the tests have performance parameters
belonging to interval (0, 1), the θi parameter indicates independence between tests
when those have perfect Gumbel dependence.
    When the diagnostic tests have perfect FGM dependence, the θ index indicates
independence and only when both tests have perfect specificities and absolutely
imperfect sensitivity (Sj = 0), the index expresses a very weak association between
tests (θ ∈ [0, 2]).
    Based on these facts, we observe that, the αi parameter has a performance
better than the θi parameter in their relations with the other parameters of asso-
ciation. For all combinations of sensitivity and specificity, αi takes values within
the range allowed by definition. When we have two binary tests negatively or pos-
itively associated with extreme values in their tests parameters, αi takes values in
the interval [0, 2] for both populations, whereas, when the two tests have perfor-
mance parameters belonging to the interval (0, 1), the αi parameter takes values
in the interval [1/2, ∞) for diseased and non-diseased individuals. For tests with
dependence structure modeled by the FGM copula, the behaviour of αi within
groups of individuals is similar to that observed when we have two binary tests.
When de dependence structure responds to the perfectly dependent Gumbel cop-
ula, in both populations, αi indicates independence between tests regardless of the
values of their performance parameters.


4. Examples
   To illustrate the performance of the indexes, we show two examples, one of
them with simulated data and the other one with a data set used by Bohning &
Patilea (2008) to illustrate their methodology.


4.1. Example with Simulated Data
   As a first example, we simulated 10000 pairs of observations with binary de-
pendence structure and the same number of pairs of data for each copula structure
(1000 diseased individuals and 9000 non-diseased individuals), considering the fol-
lowing conditions:

   • Three dependence levels: weak (0.2), moderate (0.5) and strong (0.9),

   • The dependence is the same in both populations (ψD = ψN D , ϕD = ϕN D
     and φD = φN D )

Dependence between Diagnostic Tests                                                  443

   • The specificities of the dependent tests are the same (E2 = E3 = 0.95) and
     the prevalence is relatively lower (p = 0.10)

   • Stage 1: the dependent tests have the same relatively high sensitivities (S1 =
     S2 = 0.85)

   • Stage 2: the dependent tests have the same relatively low sensitivities (S1 =
     S2 = 0.45)

    We wrote a program in R to simulate pairs of variates with the different de-
pendence forms. To simulate outcomes of the correlated binary variables Z1 , Z2
we implemented the algorithm developed by Park, Park & Shin (1996) and to
simulate the variables T1 , T2 with FGM structure and the variables V1 ,V2 with
Gumbel structure, we implemented algorithms introduced by Johnson (1987) as
follows:

  1. Binary data (ψ is the correlation coefficient)

        • Initialize p1 , p2 , q1 = 1 − p1 , q2 = 1 − p2 and ψ12
                                                    
        • Let λ11n = log 1 + q1 po−1  1 , λ22 = log 1 + q2 p−1
                                                             2   and
                             q
                                q1 q2
          λ12 = 1 + ψ12 p1 p2
        • Generate X1 ∼ Poisson(λ11 − λ12 ), X2 ∼ Poisson(λ22 − α12 ) and
          X3 ∼ Poisson(λ12 )
        • Set Y1 = X1 + X3 and Y2 = X2 + X3
        • Set Z1 = 1 if Y1 = 0, else Z1 = 0 and Z2 = 1 if Y2 = 0, else Z2 = 0
        • Then, Zj ∼ Bernoulli (pj ); j = 1, 2 and ψ12 is the correlation coefficient.

  2. FGM data (ϕ is the dependence parameter)

        • Initialize ϕ
        • Generate variates U1 ∼ U (0, 1), and U2 ∼ U (0, 1)
        • Set

                T 1 = U1
                 A = ϕ(2U1 − 1) − 1
                B = [1 − 2ϕ(2U1 − 1) + ϕ2 (2U1 − 1)2 + 4ϕU2 (2U1 − 1)]1/2
                T2 = 2U2 /(B − A)

  3. Gumbel data (φ is the dependence parameter)

        • Initialize φ
        • Generate U1 ∼ U (0, 1), U2 ∼ U (0, 1) and U3 ∼ U (0, 1)
        • Set W1 = − ln(U1 ) and Y = − ln(U2 )
        • Compute β = 1 + φW1 and q = (β − φ)/β

444                                          José Rafael Tovar & Jorge Alberto Achcar

         • If U3 < q, set W2 = βY stop
         • If U3 ≥ q, generate U4 ∼ U (0, 1), set X2 = β(Y − ln U4 ) and stop
         • Let V1 = 1 − e−W1 and V2 = 1 − e−W2

    As our data resulted from simulation, so we know all frequencies of individu-
als, but for the data analysis, we assume that we only have the total number of
individuals with negative results in both tests.
    The data analysis was made using the Bayesian paradigm, for that, we assumed
that the screening tests have positive dependence (P (ψ < 0) = P (ϕ < 0) = 0)
and we used the Beta(17,122), Beta(39.5, 39.5) and Beta(122, 17) as informative
prior distributions for the weak, moderate and strong dependences respectively.
To obtain the estimates we used a code in Winbugs software and we simulate
60, 000 Gibbs samples from the conditional distribution of each parameter. From
these generated samples, we discarded the first 10, 000 samples to eliminate the
effect of the initial values. The results obtained are showed in Table 4

   The results presented in Table 4, confirm those shown in Table 3. When the
data have a binary structure with linear dependence, both BP indexes tend to have
high values. It is important to point out that, the sensibility has little effect on the
index estimates but with low sensitivities the θ index shows a slight increase and
the α index shows a opposite behaviour. If the data have a low or moderate FGM
dependence both indexes express independence while for high FGM dependency
both indexes indicate negative association in the data, that behaviour remains
independent of the sensitivity of the tests. With low or moderate type Gumbel

Gumbel dependences the indexes express low dependence.

    Using the index estimate, we computed the estimated unknown quantities of
diseased and non-diseased individuals within group with negative outcome in both
tests (d and h in Tables 1 and 2), using equations 11 and 12. We observed that,
when the data have linear binary dependence the θ index overestimate d and nD
and underestimates h and nN D , that effect is more evident when the covariance

level is increased. With weak and moderate linear binary dependences, the α
index tends to overestimates all quantities but the observed bias is very little, if
the dependence is strong, the observed behaviour is similar to the observed with
the other index and it remains regardless of the test sensitivities. See Table 5.
    When the diagnostic tests show a weak or strong FGM dependence structure
and the sensitivities are higher than 0.5, the θ index takes a value lower than
one indicating negative dependence which underestimates nD and the estimate
value for d is negative. For moderate FGM dependences the θ index expresses
independence. If the test sensitivities are lower than 0,5, the nD and d quantities
are underestimated while nN D and h are overestimated but the estimation biases
are lower than those observed in data with linear binary dependence. For this type
of dependences with high sensitivities the α index shows estimates very close to
the true quantities but if the tests have sensitivities lower than 0.5, the behaviour
is similar to that observed with binary data however the estimation biases are
lower. See Table 5.
    The obtained results using data within dependence type Gumbel, have a be-
haviour very similar with the at observed in binary linear dependent data, but in
this case, the estimation bias is lower in all cases. Table 5



4.2. Example with Published Data

    Bohning & Patilea (2008) used a published data set to illustrate the perfor-
mance of their two indexes. The authors took the subset of data of serum choles-
terol and body mass index as risk factors for cardiovascular disease considered in
the Framingham Heart Study (Shurtleff 1974). In agreement with these authors,
for that data, conditional on the disease status, the risk factors are positively
and significantly associated as when measured by the Mantel-Haenszel odds ra-
tio with the summary taken over disease status. With the estimate values of the
indexes, they estimated the quantities of diseased and non-diseased individuals
within group with negative outcome in both tests, using for that the equations 11
and 12.
    We fit models assuming covariance, FGM dependence and Gumbel dependence
and we obtained prevalence, performance test and dependence estimates under
Bayesian paradigm. As we have six observed frequencies in the cross table and we
have seven parameters to estimate, we have a non-identifiable model. So, in the
same manner as Joseph, Gyorkos & Coupal (1995) we fitted models using Beta(a,b)
as informative prior distributions on dependence parameters and Beta(1/2, 1/2)
as non-informative prior distribution on prevalence and test parameters. Since
we have no prior information on dependence parameters, we used the three prior
distributions employed in the example with simulated data and we used the De-
viance Information Criteria (DIC) to select the better fit. With our estimates,
we computed the values of the BP indexes and we assumed that d and h are not
known, so we use the estimators db and bh to predicting the known nD and nN D .
The results are showed in Table 6.

      *Models with homogeneous dependence


    With this data set, the index values obtained after of fitting a model with
Gumbel parameter show negative dependence between test outcomes and the es-
timates of the unknown quantities are negative which makes no sense, indicating
the data do not fit well with the Gumbel copula. The model assuming binary de-
pendence eliminates the assumption of homogeneity retained by the Böhning and
FGM models. That model overestimates the numbers of individuals not verified
by “gold standard” expressing that dependence between the tests do not have lin-
ear binary structure. The results obtained using the model with FGM dependence
shows a better fit despite, it tends to underestimate both indexes a little and un-
derestimate the unknown quantities. This implies tending a contradiction because
in agreement with Bohning & Patilea (2008) when θ > 1, the expected value of ni ,
(i = D, N D) will be below the true value of n and the amount of underestimation
is determined by the value of θ; the higher value of θ, the higher the underesti-
mation; therefore, if the index values obtained with FGM fitted model are lower
than Böhning index, the estimate quantities for ni should be higher than those
observed with the Böhning model. In both models, the θ index estimate shows
better behaviour than the other index.


5. Conclusions
    In many clinical diagnostic procedures, it is necessary to use two or more
(observable or not) biological traits expressed on a continuous scale in designs that
includes verification with gold standard only for those individuals with at least one
positive outcome in the screening tests. To obtain the diagnostic, those measures
are dichotomized using a cut point, in this way, the final result is one of two values

(positive or negative). The continuous traits measured can be correlated in some
way (not necessarily linear dependence) but when performing data analysis, can
occur dependence is assumed with binary structure and not on the continuous
structure. Given that the study planning has verification bias, some values in
cross table are unknown so it is very complex to estimate the prevalence and
performance test parameters using the maximum likelihood procedure. Many
authors have considered the estimation problem using models with latent variables
to complete the data set, others as Bohning & Patilea (2008) have developed
reparametrizations using the observed incomplete data under binary structure
assumption. In this paper, we studied the performance of models developed by
Bohning & Patilea (2008) and we compared them with the performance of models
that use covariance and copula functions to obtain information on the dependence
between diagnostic tests.
    Despite the covariance and the θ index have different parametric spaces, within
the diseased population, we observed that, regardless of the population (diseased
and non-diseased individuals) it exists a perfect linear relation between them,
whenever there is the diagnostic tests have binary dependence structure, it is pos-
sible that the θ index to take values lower than zero and this range of values is
not considered within the construction of the index. To have θ < 0 indicates that
we have at least one of the tests with sensitivity zero or at least one test without
specificity and both situations are unacceptable in practical terms. The α index
does not identify covariances lower than −0.5; and when tests with perfect sen-
sitivities (Sj = 1) have a strong dependence expressed by a covariance close to
unity, the α index takes values in a very constrained range [0,2] indicating very
weak dependence; therefore, in cases where tests with perfect performance have
perfect binary dependence structure, the BP index either may indicate values not
allowed by construction or may underestimate the true dependence. It is obvious
that tests with absolutely perfect or imperfect performance is a hypothetical situ-
ation very unlikely to occur in reality. In our simulation study with more realistic
conditions, we observed that the BP indexes take values within range (0, ∞), the
relationship between covariance and α index grows more exponentially and the
same do not show strong changes with the differences in the test sensitivities.
    It is totally wrong to use the BP indexes with dichotomized data that initially
have some of the two copula dependence structures studied, therefore, to use some
of those indexes developed to binary data with dichotomized data, leads to erro-
neous conclusions regarding the dependence between tests which modify the final
diagnostic result. In this work, we used two copula functions that model weak
non linear dependences and the BP indexes failed to model them, whenever there
are many other copula families which the BP indexes relationship could be stud-
ied. On the other hand, when the continuous traits are perfectly dependent with
some of the copula structures studied, and we evaluate the dependence hypothesis
using the dichotomized results and assume binary covariance as parameter, the
estimation leads to conclude that test outcomes are independent from each other
what directly affects the estimation of the test performance parameters and the
prevalence.
