Abstract
We propose a new family of distributions called the exponentiated Kumaraswamy-G class with three extra positive parameters, which generalizes the Cordeiro and de Castro's family. Some special distributions in the new class are discussed. We derive some mathematical properties of the proposed class including explicit expressions for the quantile function, ordinary and incomplete moments, generating function, mean deviations, reliability, Rényi entropy and Shannon entropy. The method of maximum likelihood is used to t the distributions in the proposed class. Simulations are performed in order to assess the asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimates. We illustrate its potentiality with applications to two real data sets which show that the extended Weibull model in the new class provides a better t than other generalized Weibull distributions.

Resumen
Proponemos una nueva clase de distribuciones llamada la clase de Kumaraswamy-G exponenciada con tres parámetros positivos adicionales, que generaliza la familia de Cordeiro y de Castro. Se discuten algunas distribuciones especiales en la nueva clase. Derivamos algunas propiedades matemáticas de la clase propuesta, incluyendo expresiones explícitas para la función cuartil, momentos ordinarios e incompletos, función generadora, desviaciones medias, conabilidad, entropía de Rényi y entropía de Shannon. El método de máxima verosimilitud se utiliza para ajustar las distribuciones en la clase propuesta. Se realizaron simulaciones para evaluar el comportamiento asintótico de las estimaciones de máxima verosimilitud. Ilustramos su potencialidad con dos aplicaciones a dos conjuntos de datos reales que muestra que el modelo extendido de Weibull en la nueva clase proporciona un mejor ajuste que otras distribuciones generalizadas de Weibull.

1. Introduction

    One of the preferred area of research in the led of distribution is that of ge-
nerating new distributions starting with a baseline distribution by adding one or
more additional parameters. A generalized distribution may be important because
it is connected with other special distributions in interesting ways (via transfor-
mations, limits, conditioning, etc.).    In some cases, a parametric family may be
important because it can be used to model a wide variety of random phenomena.
In many cases, a special parametric family of distributions will have one or more
distinguished standard members, corresponding to specied values of some of the
parameters.   Usually the standard distributions will be mathematically simpler,
and often other members of the family can be constructed from the standard
distributions by simple transformations on the underlying standard random va-
riable. An incredible variety of special distributions have been studied over the
years, and new ones are constantly being added to the literature. Notable among
them are the Azzalini's skewed family (Azzalini 1985), Marshall-Olkin extended
(MOE) family (Marshall & Olkin 1997), exponentiated family of distributions
(Gupta, Gupta & Gupta 1998), or the composite methods of combining two or
more known competing distributions through transformations like beta genera-
ted family (Eugene, Lee & Famoye 2002, Jones 2004), gamma-generated familiy
(Zografos & Balakrishnan 2009, Ristic & Balakrishnan 2012), Kumaraswamy-G
(Kw-G) family (Cordeiro & de Castro 2011), McDonald-G family (Alexander,
Cordeiro, Ortega & Sarabia 2012), beta extended-G family (Cordeiro, Silva &
Ortega 2012), Kumaraswamy-beta generalized family (Pescim, Cordeiro, Deme-
trio, Ortega & Nadarajah 2012), exponentiated transformed transformer family
(Alzaghal, Felix & Carl 2013), exponentiated generalized family (Cordeiro, Or-
tega & Cunha 2013), geometric exponential-Poisson family (Nadarajah, Cancho
& Ortega 2013), truncated-exponential skew symmetric family (Nadarajah, Ja-

yakumar & Ristic 2013), logistic generated family (Torabi & Montazari 2014),
Kumaraswamy Marshall-Olkin-G family (Alizadeh, Tahir, Cordeiro, Zubair &
Hamedani 2015), generalized gamma-Weibull distribution (Meshkat, Torabi &
Hamedani 2016), generalized odd log-logistic family (Cordeiro, Alizadeh, Tahir,
Mansoor, Bourguignon & G. 2017), generalized transmuted-G family (Nofal, Afy,
Yousof & Cordeiro 2017) and odd Lindley-G family (Gomes-Silva, Percontini,
Brito, Ramos, Silva & Cordeiro 2017). While the additional parameter(s) bring in
more exibility at the same time they also complicate the mathematical form of
the resulting distribution, often considerably enough to render it not amenable to
further analytical and numerical manipulations. But with the advent of sophisti-
cated powerful mathematical and statistical softwares more complex distributions
are getting accepted as useful models for data analysis. Tahir & Nadarajah (2015)
provided a detail review of how new families of univariate continuous distributions
can be generated through introduction of additional parameter(s).

   Cordeiro & de Castro (2011) dened the Kw-G family as follows.               If G(x)
denotes the cumulative distribution function (cdf ) of a random variable, the Kw-
G cdf family is

                                                     b
                            Ha,b (x) = 1 − 1 − Ga (x) ,
                                          
                                                                                    (1)

where a > 0 and b > 0 are two additional shape parameters to the G distribution,
whose role is to govern skewness and tail weights. The cdf (1) compares extremely
favorably in terms of simplicity with the beta cdf. The probability density function
(pdf ) corresponding to (1) is

                                                           b−1
                    ha,b (x) = a b g(x) Ga−1 (x) 1 − Ga (x)
                                                
                                                                ,                   (2)

where g(x) = dG(x)/dx. Equation (2) does not involve any special function, such
as the incomplete beta function, as is the case of the beta-G family pionnered by
Eugene et al. (2002). So, the Kw-G family is obtained by adding two shape para-
meters a and b to the G distribution. The generalization (2) contains distributions
with unimodal and bathtub shaped hazard rates.         It also contemplates a broad
class of models with monotonic hazard rate functions (hrf 's).

   In this paper, we dene a new class of distributions that extends the Kw-G
family and derive some of its structural properties.      Based on a continuous cdf
Ha,b (x) given by (1), the class of exponentiated Ha,b distributions is dened by
                                   c
                                                           b c
                                      (x) = 1 − 1 − Ga (x)

                    Fa,b,c (x) = Ha,b                           ,               (3)

where a > 0, b > 0 and c > 0 are three additional shape parameters to the G
distribution. The pdf corresponding to (3) is

                                                  b−1                b c−1
       fa,b,c (x) = a b c g(x) Ga−1 (x) 1 − Ga (x)       1 − 1 − Ga (x)

      The   exponentiated Kw-G class (EKw-G for short) of densities (4) allows for
greater exibility of its tails and can be widely applied in many areas of engineering
and biology. We study some structural properties of (4) because it extends several
well-known distributions in the literature. In the next sections some mathematical
properties of the new class are derived.          The density function (4) will be most
tractable when the cdf G(x) and pdf g(x) have simple analytic expressions. Note
that even if g(x) is a symmetric distribution, the distribution f (x) will not be
symmetric. The three extra parameters in (4) can control both tail weights and
possibly adding entropy to the center of the EKw-G density function. Henceforth,
X ∼EKw-G(a, b, c) denotes a random variable having density function (4). Each
new EKw-G distribution can be obtained from a specied G model. For a = b =
c = 1, the G distribution is a special model of the EKw-G class with a continuous
crossover towards cases with dierent shapes (e.g., a particular combination of
skewness and kurtosis). Some cases of EKw-G have been discussed and explored
in recent works. Here, we refer to the papers and baseline distributions: Huang &
Oluyede (2014) for the Dagum, Rodrigues & Silva (2015) for the exponential and
Rodrigues, Silva & Hamedani (2016) for the inverse Weibull. One major benet
of the family (4) is its ability of tting skewed data that can not be properly tted
by existing distributions.

      We dene the exponentiated-G (Exp-G) random variable Z with power pa-
rameter c > 0 from an arbitrary baseline distribution G, say Z             ∼ Expc G, if Z
                                              c                          c−1
has cdf and pdf given by Πc (x) = G(x)            and πc (x) = cg(x)G(x)       , respectively.
This model is also called the Lehmann type I distribution. Note that there is a
                            c
dual transformation Exp (1 − G) referred to as the Lehmann type II distribution
                                                       c
corresponding to the cdf F (x) = 1 − [1 − G(x)] . Thus, equation (3) encompasses
                                c                                                c
both Lehmann type I (Exp G for a = b = 1) and Lehmann type II (Exp (1− G) for
                                                                             c
                                                                               
a = c= 1) distributions
                        (Lehmann 1953). Clearly, the triple construction Exp 1-
      b        a
Exp       1-Exp G    generates the EKw-G class of distributions. Several properties
of the EKw-G class can be derived using this triple transformation.

    The EKw-G class shares an attractive physical interpretation whenever a, b and
c are positive integers. Consider a device made of c independent components in a
parallel system. Further, each component is made of b independent subcomponents
                                                a
identically distributed according to G(x) in a series system. The device fails if
all c components fail and each component fails if any subcomponent fails. Let
Xj1 , . . . , Xjc denote the lifetimes of the subcomponents within the j th component
(j = 1, . . . , b) with common cdf G(x). Let Xj denote the lifetime of the jth
component and let X denote the lifetime of the device. Thus, the cdf of X is given
by

                                                                                     c

So, the lifetime of the device follows the EKw-G family of distributions.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows.      In Section 2, we present four
special models of the EKw-G class by extending the Weibull, Gumbel, gamma and
Burr XII distributions. Section 3 provides two useful expansions for the EKw-G
class. The quantile function and moments of X are derived in Sections 4 and 5,
respectively.   Generating function and mean deviations are obtained in Sections
6 and 7, respectively.    The Rényi and Shannon entropies and the reliability are
determined in Sections 8 and 9, respectively.        Maximum likelihood estimation
is discussed in Section 10.     In Section 11, we provide a simulation study.         An
application to a real data set is performed in Section 12. Some concluding remarks
are addressed in Section 13.




2. Special Models

   Next, we present four EKw-G distributions.



2.1. Exponentiated Kumaraswamy Weibull (EKwW)
                                                                             −(βx)α
   The Weibull cdf with parameters β > 0 and α > 0 is G(x) = 1 − e                    (for
x > 0). The cdf of a random variable X having the EKwW distribution, say X∼
EKwW(a, b, c, α, β), can be expressed as

                                                     α a b c
                     F EKwW (x) = 1 − 1 − 1 − e−(βx)
                                    
                                                               ,

and the associated density function reduces to

                                         α            α a−1                α a b−1
                = a b c α β α xα−1 e−(βx) 1 − e−(βx)           1 − 1 − e−(βx)
                                                                  
f EKwW (x)
                                         α a b c−1
                    1 − 1 − 1 − e−(βx)
                        
                ×                                    .                              (5)


The hrf corresponding to (5) is given by

                                      α              α a−1                α a b−1
  τ EKwW (x) = a b c α β α xα−1 e−(βx) 1 − e−(βx)              1 − 1 − e−(βx)
                                                                  
                                      α a b c−1
             × 1 − 1 − 1 − e−(βx)
                    
                                             α a b c −1
             × 1 − 1 − 1 − 1 − e−(βx)
                               
                                                           .

For c = 1, we obtain as a special model the Kw-Weibull (KwW) distribution. The
most important case of (5) is the exponentiated Weibull (EW) (when b = c = 1)
pioneered by Mudholkar and Srivastawa (Mudholkar & Srivastava 1993).               Plots
of the density and hrf of the EKwW distribution for some parameter values are
displayed in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

3. Useful Expansions

     The pdf (4) can be expressed as a linear combination of Kw-G density functions.
Using the generalized binomial expansion, we can rewrite (4) as
                                      ∞
                                      X
                            f (x) =         vj ha,(j+1) b (x),                            (6)
                                      j=0

where
                                        
                                      c−1
                                      j
                           vj = (−1)       , j = 0, 1, . . . .
                                       j
The cdf corresponding to (6) can be expressed as
                                      ∞
                                      X
                            F (x) =         vj Ha,(j+1) b (x).                            (7)
                                      j=0

Based on equations (6) and (7) some structural properties of the EKw-G class
can be obtained from well-established Kw-G properties. These equations can also
be expressed as linear combinations of Exp-G distributions. Substituting (2) in
equation (6) and using the binomial expansion, we obtain
                                      ∞
                                      X
                            f (x) =         wk π(k+1) a (x),                              (8)

                        k + 1 j=0        j         k

Integrating (8), we have
                                      ∞
                                      X
                            F (x) =         wk Π(k+1)a (x),                               (9)
                                      k=0

where Π(k+1) a (x) denotes the Exp-G cdf with power parameter (k + 1) a. Equa-
tion (8) reveals that the EKw-G density function is a linear combination of Exp-G
densities. Thus, some structural properties of the EKw-G class such as the ordi-
nary and incomplete moments and generating function can be obtained from well
known Exp-G properties.

     Several Exp-G properties have been studied by many authors in recent years,

et al. (Mudholkar, Srivastava & Kollia 1996) for exponentiated Weibull, Gupta
et al. (Gupta et al. 1998) for exponentiated Pareto, Gupta and Kundu (Gupta

4. Quantile Function

                                                            −1
   The EKw-G quantile function, say Q(u) = F                     (u), is straightforward to be
computed by inverting (3) provided a closed-form expression for the baseline quan-
                         −1
tile function QG (u) = G      (u) is available. From equation (3), we can write
                                  h            1/b i1/a 
                    Q(u) = QG       1 − 1 − u1/c            .                            (10)



   For example, the EKwBXII quantile function comes by inverting the cdf in
Section 2.4 as

                            n   h            1/b i1/a  −1
                                                           k
                                                                o p1
                 Q(u) = s     1 − 1 − 1 − u1/c                −1 .                       (11)



   The shortcomings of the classical kurtosis measure are well-known.                   There
are many heavy-tailed distributions for which this quantile is innite. So, it be-
comes uninformative precisely when it needs to be.                 Indeed, our motivation to
use quantile-based measures stemmed from the non-existence of classical skewness
and kurtosis for several generalized distributions. The Bowley skewness (Kenney
& Keeping 1962) is based on quartiles


                                Q(3/4) − 2Q(1/2) + Q(1/4)
                        B=                                ,
                                    Q(3/4) − Q(1/4)

whereas the Moors kurtosis (Moors 1988) is based on octiles


                            Q(7/8) − Q(5/8) + Q(3/8) − Q(1/8)
                    M=                                        ,
                                     Q(6/8) − Q(2/8)

where Q(·) denotes the quantile function given by (10).                Plots of the B and M
functions for the EKwBXII distribution computed from (11) are displayed (for
some parameter values) in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. These plots indicate a
high dependence of these measures on the generator parameters of the new class.

   Here, we derive a power series for the quantile function (10). If the baseline
                                −1
quantile function QG (u) = G         (u) does not have a closed-form expression, it can
usually be expressed in terms of a power series

                                            ∞
                                            X
                                QG (u) =          ai ui ,                                (12)
                                            i=0

where the coecients ai are suitably chosen real numbers which depend on the
parameters of the G distribution. For several important distributions, such as the
normal, Student t, gamma and beta distributions, QG (u) does not have explicit
expressions, but it can be expanded as in equation (12). As a simple example, for
the normal N (0, 1) distribution, ai = 0 for i = 0, 2, 4, . . . and a1 = 1, a3 = 1/6,
a5 = 7/120 and a7 = 127/7560, . . ..

     Equation (15) is the main result of this section since it allows to obtain vari-
ous mathematical quantities for the EKw-G class as proved in the next sections.

The Exponentiated Kumaraswamy-G Class                                                               13



The formula derived throughout the paper can be easily handled in most sym-
bolic computation software platforms such as Maple and Mathematica since they
have currently the ability to deal with analytic expressions of formidable size and
complexity. The innity limit in the sums can be substituted by a large positive
integer such as 20 or 30 for most practical purposes.




5. Moments

   Hereafter, we shall assume that G is the cdf of a random variable Y and that
F is the cdf of a random variable X having density function (4). The moments of
X can be obtained from the (r, s) th probability weighted moments (PWMs) of Y
dened by
                                                            Z ∞
                                  r       s
                   τr,s = E[Y G (Y )] =                              y r G s (y) g(y) dy.
                                                             −∞

   An alternative formula for τr,s can be based on the baseline quantile function
QG (x) = G−1 (x). Setting G(x) = u, we obtain
                                  Z 1
                          τr,s =      QGr (u) us du.                         (16)

   We use throughout the paper a result of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (Gradshteyn
& Ryzhik 2007) for a power series raised to a positive integer k (for k ≥ 1)

where the coecients ck,l (for l = 1, 2, . . .) are easily obtained from the recurrence
                           k
equation (with ck,0 = b0 )

                                              l

                       ck,l = (l b0 )−1             [m(k + 1) − l] bm ck,l−m .                    (18)
                                          m=1

Clearly, ck,l can be determined from ck,0 , . . . , ck,l−1 and then from the quantities
b0 , . . . , b l .
   We can write using (12), (17) and (18)

where er,i = (i a0 )     m=1 [m(r + 1) − i] am er,i−m and er,0 = a0 and then an
alternative expression for τr,s follows as

                                              X      er,i

     From equation (8), we can write

                                           ∞
                                           X
                          E(X r ) =              pk τr,(k+1)a−1 ,                                (21)
                                           k=0

where

                                      ∞                                   

Thus, the EKw-G moments can be expressed as an innite weighted sum of the
baseline PWMs.      The ordinary moments of several EKw-G distributions can be
determined directly from equations (16) and (21).                        Expressions for moments of
several exponentiated distributions are given by Nadarajah and Kotz (Nadarajah
                                                                     r
& Kotz 2006), which can be useful to produce E(X                         ). Table 1 gives some values
from equation (21) for the EKw-exponential model (parameter λ) with dierent
parameter values.

calculated from (8) as

                                ∞
                                X          Z z
                    mh (z) =          pk         xh g(x) G(k+1) a−1 (x) dx.
                                k=0         0


Setting u = G(x), we obtain

                                            X

where

                                      Z G(z)
                       ϑh,k (z) =                    QhG (u) u(k+1) a−1 du.

     The quantity ϑh,k (z) is available for some baseline distributions and can also
be computed numerically for most of them.

6. Generating Function

                                                                            tX
     The moment generating function (mgf ) M (t) = E(e                           ) of X comes from (8)
as an innite weighted sum

                                               ∞
                                               X
                                    M (t) =           wk M(k+1) a (t),
                                               k=0

where M(k+1) a (t) is the mgf of Y(k+1) a ∼ Exp-G((k + 1)a). Hence, M (t) can be
determined from the mgf of Y(k+1) a given by

                                                     Z ∞
                M(k+1) a (t) = (k + 1) a                   etx g(x)G(x)(k+1)a−1 dx.
                                                      0

Setting G(x) = u, we can write Mk (t) in terms of the baseline quantile function
QG (x)
                                                    Z 1
                M(k+1) a (t) = (k + 1) a                  exp[t QG (u)] u(k+1)a−1 du.
                                                     0


     Now, we provide four representations for M (t). The rst one comes from (8)
as

                                               ∞
                                               X
                                    M (t) =           wk M(k+1) a (t).
                                               k=0


     A second representation for M (t) is obtained from

                                              ∞
                                              X
                             f (x) = g(x)            tk G(k+1) a−1 (x),                           (23)
                                              k=0

                    k
                             P∞           j    c
                                                     (j+1)b−1
where tk = (−1)         ab     j=0 (−1)                           . Thus,
                                              j+1          k

                                                ∞
                                              X
                                M (t) = E etX =   tk ξk (t; a),
                                                           k=0
                    R∞
where ξk (t; a) =
                        −∞
                             etx g(x) G(k+1) a−1 (x) dx.
                                   −1
     Setting x = QG (u) = G             (u) in (23), a third representation follows as
                                               ∞
                                               X
                                   M (t) =           tk ρ(k+1) a−1 (t),
                                               k=0

where
                                              Z 1
                                  ρa (t) =          exp[t QG (u)] ua du.
                                               0


                                                     Revista Colombiana de Estadística 42 (2019) 133

     A fourth representation can be determined from (19) by expanding the expo-
nential function in the last equation

                                           ∞
                                           X         en,i tn
                                ρa (t) =                        .
                                           n,i=0
                                                 (i + a + 1) n!

     The best representation to derive a closed-form expression for M (t) depends
essentially on the forms of the pdf, cdf and quantile function of G.




7. Mean Deviations

8. Entropies

     The entropy of a random variable X with density function f (x) is a measure
of variation of the uncertainty. Two popular entropy measures are due to Shannon
and Rényi (Shannon 1951, Rényi 1961). A large value of the entropy indicates the
greater uncertainty in the data. The Rényi entropy is dened by (for γ > 0 and
γ 6= 1)
                                                   Z ∞                  

9. Reliability

     The component fails at the instant that the random stress X2 applied to it
exceeds the random strength X1 , and the component will function satisfactorily
whenever X1 > X2 . Hence, R = P (X2 < X1 ) is a measure of component relia-
bility. It has many applications especially in the area of engineering. We derive
the reliability R when X1 and X2 have independent EKw-G(a1 , b1 , c1 ) and EKw-
G(a2 , b2 , c2 ) distributions with the same parameter vector η for G. The reliability
is dened by

Setting u = G(x), we obtain

11. Simulations

     We perform some simulations with the objective to note the behavior of the
MLEs obtained by the BFGS method. It is used for maximizing the log-likelihood
function of a probabilistic model. In some complex distributions the task of opti-
mization can be quite complicated.

     We consider ten thousand replicas of Monte Carlo (MC) under dierent sample
sizes (n = 20, 60, 100, 200, 500 and 1000). For each sample size, we compute the
average MLEs obtained by the BFGS method and correct these estimates by using
non-parametric bootstrap. We also compute the bootstrap errors and the biases
of the MLEs for the model parameters by considerig the exponential distribution
with parameter λ > 0 as the baseline in Table 4.                Similarly, we perform other
simulations with the same scenarios by considering the Weibull distribution with
parameters α = 1.1 and β = 1.5 (xed) as the baseline (Table 5).



                                              Revista Colombiana de Estadística 42 (2019) 133

The Exponentiated Kumaraswamy-G Class                                               21



   The corrected MLEs are based on 500 replicas of bootstrap and the true pa-
rameter values considered are a = b = c = λ = 1.1. For each MC iteration, we
consider only samples in which there have been convergence of the BFGS method.
It is very important to eliminate the non-convergence of the simulations, for not
mislead the results obtained and with the penalty of having simulations in some
problems involving the new class of distributions.    Computationally intensive of
akwards log-likelihood for som families of distributions are fairly complicated, ha-
ving many regions approximately at. In our case, to carry out the simulations we
use a computer with 32 GB of RAM memory, operating system Arch Linux with
processor Intel Core i7-4710QM octa core with each core working at a frequency
of 3.5 GHz.

   We implement the code using the Julia version 0.6.3 programming language
which is a pseudo-compiled general-purpose language and has several functions
that facilitate its use in scientic computing.   Julia is a language that provides
several advantages when considering the implementation in statistical simulations
that are usually computationally intensive. Among these advantages can be high-
lighted its computational eciency by using a Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
based compiler with run-time compilation (JIT). JIT computing solutions exist in
language like R (see compiler package), however it is something that has been re-
cently developed unlike Julia which is a compiled language by denition. Several
benckmarks can be obtained on the web showing the superiority with respect to the
computational eciency of the language Julia comparing it with other languages.

   In addition to being a compiled language by denition,        Julia is a program-
ming language that is being designed for parallel computing and does not impose
any specic parallelism to the programmer. Instead, it provides several important
building blocks for distributed computing, making it exible enough to support
multiple styles of parallelism and allowing users to add other styles. In order to
use all the computational resources of the available hardware, each Monte Carlo
iteration was broken into threads using the macro @threads. In this way, it was
possible to perform eight iterations simultaneously at every step. In order to be
able to execute the code below it is necessary to install the libraries Distributions
and Optim to have access to some functions of probability distributions and global
optimization, respectively.   In Appendix we provide the Julia script setting the
exponential distribution for G.   By the simulations it is possible to observe im-
provements in the MLEs obtained when using bootstrap correction. However, the
corrections are more signicant and perhaps more justiable in small sample sizes
(20 or 60).




12. Applications

   In this section, we t the EKwW distribution to two real data sets and for
illustrative purposes also present a comparative study with the ts of some nes-
ted and non-nested models.     These applications prove empirically the exibility
of the new distribution in modeling positive data. All the computations are per-
formed using the   R software (R Development Core Team, R: A Language and

models based on the values of W                  and A .       This model may be an interesting
alternative to other models available in the literature for modeling positive real

   More information is provided by a visual comparison of the histograms of
the data sets and the main tted densities (Figures 10 and 11).                     These plots
indicate that the new distribution provides a good t to both data and it is a very
compettitive model to the classical EW and BW distributions.

13. Conclusions

  A new family of continuous distributions called the exponentiated Kumaras-
wamy-G (EKw-G) class is introduced and studied. The proposed class contains
three parameters more than those in the baseline distribution. Several new mo-
dels can be generated based on this family by considering special cased for G. We
demonstrate that the EKw-G density function can be expressed as a linear com-
bination of exponentiated-G (Exp-G) density functions. This result allows us to
obtain general explicit expressions for some measures of the EKw-G class such as
the ordinary and incomplete moments, generating function and mean deviations.

The Exponentiated Kumaraswamy-G Class                                                 27



Explicit expressions for two types of entropy and reliability are given. We provide
a power series for the quantile function which holds in generality. We discuss max-
imum likelihood estimation. A simulation study is performed by means of Monte
Carlo experiments with the objective to observe the behavior of the maximum
likelihood estimates obtained by the BFGS method. The inference on the model
parameters is based on Cramér-von Mises and Anderson-Darling statistics. Two
applications of a special model of the proposed class to real data demonstrates
its potentiality. We hope this generalization may attract several applications in
statistics, biology, engineering and other areas.
