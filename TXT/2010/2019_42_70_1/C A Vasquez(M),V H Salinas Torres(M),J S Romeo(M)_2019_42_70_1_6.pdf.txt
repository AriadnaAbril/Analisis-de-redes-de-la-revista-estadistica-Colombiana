Finally, a case study is considered, the Bayesian methodology is applied to estimate the limiting availability of a palletizer, which is used in the packaging of glass bottles. Extensions to a coherent system are also discussed.

1. Introduction

    Consider a component that is placed in operation at time t = 0. At any time
if the component fails, it is repaired or replaced by another component, starting
back to work the same way as when the component was new, thus we have a
sequence of independent and identically distributed lifetime variables. When a
component fails, this is o for a certain period of time, which is called repair time
of the component. It is assumed that repair times are mutually independent and
independent of future lifetimes, i.e., the repair or replacement of the component
does not aect the future performance of the component. Such a situation can be
modelled by an alternating renewal process.
    Let {Xn }n∈N and {Yn }n∈N two sequences of non-negative independent random
variables so that the sequences are mutually independent. X has cumulative dis-
tribution function given by FX (·), with mean µX and variance σX 2
                                                                   < ∞, and Y
has cumulative distribution function FY (·), with mean µY and variance σY2 < ∞.
If                          (P
                                 n
                                 i=1 (Xi + Yi ), and n ≥ 1
                       Sn =
                              0, and n = 0

and Sn+1
      0
           = Sn + Xn+1 , the sequence {Xn , Yn }n∈N denes a stochastic process
{R(t) : t ∈ [0, ∞)} known as alternating renewal process where
                           (
                                                          0
                             1, ∃ n ∈ N ∪ {0} : Sn ≤ t < Sn+1
                    R(t) =
                             0, otherwise.

    If {Xn }n∈N and {Yn }n∈N are sequences between failures times and repair times,
respectively, then Sn corresponds to the time to repair (or replacement) of the n-th
failure, and thus Sm0
                       is the time until the m-th failure. Thus, the variable R(t)
takes the value 1 if the component is working at the time instant t > 0 and takes
the value 0 if the component is not operating on t > 0.
   The point availability of a repairable system A(t) is the probability that the
system is operating at time t, i.e.,

                                 A(t) = P(R(t) = 1).                                 (1)

    Certainly it is desired to nd the expression of A(t), but this is too hard except
for a few simple cases (Sarkar & Chandhuri 1999). In practice, there is interest in
the steady system availability, say A.
    A random variable is called lattice, if it only takes on integral multiples of some
nonnegative number d. The largest d having this property is said to be the period
of the random variable. If a random variable is lattice, we say that its cumulative
function distribution is lattice, see, for example, Ross (1996). If the distribution
FT (·) of Ti = Xi + Yi is not lattice, then the limit availability is given by Barlow
& Proschan (1996).

Bayesian Estimation of the Limiting Availability                                    125

The term availability here refers to the ability of a component to operate over a
certain period of time. The term operate refers to the fact that item is operating
or able to operate if required. This result is very important because it not only
allows an easy calculation of the limit availability, but also in turn bring the
availability of a component or system in the long term, i.e., in a stationary state.
Examples of these are the case of mineral conveyor belts in large mining, in a
series arrangement, industrial washing systems in a parallel arrangement and the
so-called Kanban system (card in Japanese), which is a linear system of production
cells (Marsan, Balbo, Conte, Donatelli & Franceschinis 1995). A clever deduction
of Equation (2), via renewal theory, can be found in Vásquez (2006).
    Estimation of the point and limiting availabilities has been discussed by many
authors using Bayesian and classical methods. Thompson & Palicio (1975) present
a numerical procedure for computing Bayes credibility interval and the condence
interval estimation is considered by Mi (1991), in a series system case. Moreover,
Baxter & Li (1994) and Baxter & Li (1996), focus on making the estimation of
availability and limiting availability using a nonparametric approach, invoking the
product-limit estimator (Kaplan & Meier 1958) when the data are subject to right
censorship. More recently, Abraham & Balakrishna (2000) estimate the limiting
availability for a system with failure and repair times from a stationary bivariate
sequence. The limiting availability with non-identical failure and repair times dis-
tributions is considered by Mi (2006). On the other hand, Ananda (1999) considers
the estimation of the long-run availability of a parallel system having several inde-
pendent renewable components with exponentially distributed failure and repair
times.The statistical inference about the steady state availability, with particular
Gamma lifetime and repair time is considered by Lu & Mi (2011). The k -out-of-n
system is studied by Mishra & Jain (2013), with exponential failure time and dif-
ferent distributions of the repair time. The interval estimation (computation) of
the reliability (availability) is the subject of Huang & Mi (2013) and Mathew &
Balakrishna (2014). An interesting application of the estimation of the availability
of wind farm electric system can be found in Sobolewski (2016). All these works
are addressed under a standard approach. Furthermore a general model for repair
models is dened in Sethuraman & Hollander (2009) under a nonparametric Bayes
setting.
    This work proposes a Bayesian estimation method for the limiting availability
of an one-unit system. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not
been studied in the literature yet. In Section 2 we revisited the methodology of
maximum likelihood estimation. The Bayesian approach is presented in Section 3.
In both sections, simulation studies are carried out in order to analyze the behavior
of the estimators. We focussed our work on one-unit systems, with exponential
(respectively gamma) distributions for failure and repair times. The exponential
distribution is a standard referent in reliability. In particular, it is used when a
certain component does not wear out over time. On the other hand, the Gamma
distribution takes into account a larger family of models and allows to include
the possibility that the failure rate varies as a function of time.The Bayesian
methodology, presented in this paper, is applied considering these distributions
(failure/repair times), since they allow us to develop a conjugate analysis, having as

a priori distribution the generalized Beta distribution. The analytical development
can be carried out completely. However, the use of other distributions should make
use of methods of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo type. In addition, this involves
certain aspects that could be useful, from the educational statistical point of view.
A case study is considered in Section 4, the Bayesian methodology is applied to
estimate the limiting availability of a palletizer, which is used in the packaging of
glass bottles. This machine (manually operated) is commonly used in a certain
Chilean factory of glass bottles or similar. Finally, a discussion and extensions are
presented in Section 5.


2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

    In this section, we revisit the maximum likelihood estimation of the limiting
availability. Also, we estimate the variance of the estimator using a Taylor expan-
sion, in concordance with Baxter & Li (1996).
  Consider X the failure time with mean µX and Y the repairable time with
mean µY .
   Let X = (X1 , . . . , Xn ) be a random sample of size n of the failure times and
Y = (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) a random sample of size m of the repairable times. If the
samples are independent, then the complete likelihood function is the product of
the marginal likelihoods, i.e.,

                         L(µX , µY ; x, y) = L(µX ; x) × L(µY ; y).                                 (3)

   By the invariance principle (Zacks 1971) the maximum likelihood estimator of
the limiting availability A is given by

                                                    µ
                                                    bX
                                       A
                                       bmle =             .                                         (4)

                                                  µ    bY

    Following Baxter & Li (1996), for the calculus of the variance of the estimator,
we consider a Taylor expansion of second order of the function
f (u, v) = u/(u + v), (u, v) ∈ (0, ∞) × (0, ∞), around the point (a, b), i.e.,

                       ∂f (a, b)           ∂f (a, b)
 f (u, v) ≈ f (a, b) +           (u − a) +           (v − b)

Bayesian Estimation of the Limiting Availability                                     127

    Now, by using the consistency property of the MLE for (µX , µY ), the variance
of the estimator of the limiting availability can be approximated by

                               µ2Y                      µ2X

2.1. Simulation Study

    In the simulation study, we consider two repairable systems. In the rst system,
failure and repair times follow exponential distributions. In the second, failure time
follows a gamma distribution and repair time an exponential law. In this process,
we use R software, version 3.4.1 (R Development Core Team 2007).

2.1.1. Exponential-Exponential System

    Consider {Xn , Yn } a repairable system, where X has a probability density
function (pdf) given by f (x|µ) = µ1 e−x/µ , x > 0, and Y has a pdf f (y|λ) =
 1 −y/λ
λe      , y > 0. In this case µX = µ, µY = λ and A = µ+λ
                                                      µ
                                                         . The simulation study
considers 1000 repetitions for each simulation. Now, we present some notations
and summary statistics used in the simulations.

   • µ and λ are the parameters of the failure time and repair time, respectively.

   • n, m are the number of observations from X and Y .

     b corresponds to the mean of the limiting availability estimates, i.e.,
   • A

       i=1 Ai /1000.
           b

   • σ̂ 2 is the mean of the estimated variances dened in (7).

       b is the empirical quadratic error of the mean limiting availability, which
       2

     is dened by, SÂ

                       = i=1 A

   • CP T is the probability of containing the true simulate limiting availability
     based on 95% condence intervals.

   • M A is the mean of amplitudes of the intervals in the 1000 repetitions for the
     limiting availability estimate.

   • 95%−Interval corresponds to the mean of the 95%−condence interval over
     the 1000 repetitions for the limiting availability.

      The results of the simulation are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
   In Table 1, the quadratic error of the estimator and the mean of variabilities
present a similar behavior, depending on sample sizes. Probabilities of containing
the true limiting availability tend to 0.95 when the sample sizes are similar. In
Table 2 the quadratic error of the estimator and the variance converge to the same
value faster than in the rst case.

2.1.2. Gamma-Exponential System

      Consider a repairable system, where X has a pdf f (x | α, β) = β α Γ(α)
                                                                         1

x > 0 and Y has a pdf f (y | λ) = λ1 e−y/λ , y > 0. In this case, µX = αβ , µY = λ
and the limiting availability is A = αβ/(αβ + λ). The simulation study considers
1000 repetitions for each simulation. We use the same notations and summary
statistics used in the previous simulation. Table 3 and Table 4 present the results
of the simulation.

    From the results of the simulation (Tables 3 and 4), approximate variances
via delta method and quadratic error of estimators are similar as the sample size
increases. In the same way, probabilities of containing the true limiting availability
tend to 0.95.

3. Bayesian Estimation

    In this section, we apply the Bayesian approach to the problem of estimation
of the limiting availability. Specically, we analyze the two repairable systems,
which were described in the previous section. In this context, we must elicit a
prior distribution for the limiting availability. This can be made by dening in a
rst stage prior distributions for the parameters of the observational model. The
inference of the limiting availability will be based on its posterior distribution. We
are considering two cases: informative and less informative prior distributions.


3.1. Elicitation of the Prior Distribution

   Consider X the failure time with pdf f (x | µ) and Y the repairable time with
pdf f (y | λ), such that µX = µ, µY = λ, so A = µ/(µ + λ). Let µ ∼ π(µ) and
λ ∼ π(λ) be the prior densities for µ and λ, respectively. Assuming independence,
the joint prior for (µ, λ) is given by π(µ, λ) = π(µ) × π(λ).
   We are interested in determining the prior density of the limiting availability
A. So, consider the following change of variables θ = A = µ+λ
                                                           µ
                                                               , φ = µ + λ. Then
the joint distribution of the vector (θ, φ) is given by


                                                                             θ ∈ Θ , φ ∈ Φ,
                                                             
                     πµ (µ(θ, φ))πλ (λ(θ, φ)) J (µ, λ), (θ, φ) ,
     π(θ, φ) =
                     0,                                                      θ 6∈ Θ, φ 6∈ Φ.

where µ(θ, φ) = θφ and λ(θ, φ) = φ(1 − θ). Also, Θ is the parameter space of θ
and Φ is the parameter space of φ.
   The Jacobian of the transformation is given by

                                              ∂µ          ∂µ
                                             ∂θ          ∂φ         φ   θ
              J (µ, λ), (θ, φ) =                                =                = φ.
                                              ∂λ          ∂λ        −φ 1 − θ
                                              ∂θ          ∂φ
   Marginalizing, the prior density of θ = A is
                                      Z
                             π(θ) =           πµ (θφ)πλ (φ(1 − θ))φdφ.                          (8)

    The following result is a direct extension of the characterization of the Beta
distribution, through two independent Gamma random variables, with the same
scale parameter. Although the proposition is a direct consequence of the work of
Libby & Novick (1982), we prefer to include the demonstration in order to have a
greater understanding in the reading of the article.

Proposition 1. If µ ∼ Gamma(a1 , b1 ) and λ ∼ Gamma(a2 , b2 ) then θ = A
is Generalized Beta distributed with parameters (a1 , a2 , b1 /b2 ), i.e., θ = A ∼
GB3(a1 , a2 , b1 /b2 ).

Proof . We have
                                       Z ∞
                              π(θ) =         πµ (θφ)πλ (φ(1 − θ))φdφ.
                                       0

      Then
                    Z ∞                              (a )
                             ba1 1                     b 2
       π(θ)    =                   (θφ)a1 −1 e−b1 θφ 2 (φ(1 − θ))a2 −1 e−b2 φ(1−θ) φdφ
                     0     Γ(a1 )                      Γa2
                        a1 a2                             Z ∞
                       b1 b2
               =                    θa1 −1 (1 − θ)a2 −1         φa1 +a2 −1 e−φ(b1 θ+b2 (1−θ)) dφ
                    Γ(a1 )Γ(a2 )                           0
                       ba1 1 ba2 2    a1 −1         a2 −1        Γ(a1 + a2 )
               =                    θ       (1 − θ)
                    Γ(a1 )Γ(a2 )                          (b1 θ + b2 (1 − θ))a1 +a2

      So,

                                   θa1 −1 (1 − θ)a2 −1
                      π(θ) ∝                      a1 +a2 , 0 < θ < 1,                            (9)
                                  1 − (1 − bb21 )θ

this last expression corresponds to the kernel of a Generalized Beta density with
parameters (a1 , a2 , b1 /b2 ), see Chen & Novick (1996).

    Note that, if b1 = b2 we obtain the usual beta distribution of parameters
(a1 , a2 ).
    The calculus of the noninformative prior for the limiting availability is anal-
ogous. In this part, we calculate the Jereys (1996) prior distribution for the
limiting availability A. Considering the same scheme, the likelihood function of
(µ, λ) is L(µ, λ; x, y) = L(µ; x)L(λ; y).
      Then the Fisher information matrix of (µ, λ) is given by
                           2                     2                  
                          E − ∂ log L(µ,λ;x,y)
                                     ∂µ2         E  − ∂ log L(µ,λ;x,y)
                                                           ∂µ∂λ
                                                                        
              I(µ, λ) = 
                          2                      2                  ,
                                                                         
                                    L(µ,λ;x,y)
                          E − ∂ log ∂µ∂λ         E − ∂ log L(µ,λ;x,y)
                                                            ∂λ2


so, the Jereys prior for (µ, λ) is π(µ, λ) ∝ |I(µ, λ)|1/2 .

    Analogously,

                             |I(µ(θ, φ), λ(θ, φ))|1/2 J (µ, λ), (θ, φ) ,
                                                                      
               π(θ, φ) ∝

where µ = µ(θ, φ) = θφ and λ = λ(θ, φ) = φ(1 − θ). When it is possible, one must
marginalize π(θ, φ) to obtain the noninformative prior for the limiting availability
θ = A.


3.2. Calculus of the Posterior Distribution

    In this section, we calculate the posterior density function of the limiting avail-
ability A. Recall, the failure time X has a pdf f (x | µ), µX = µ and the repair
time Y has a pdf f (x | λ), µY = λ. The limiting availability is A = µ/(µ + λ).
First, we reparametrize the likelihood function, considering θ = µ/(µ + λ) and
φ = µ + λ, which was used in the determination of the prior distribution in the
previous section.
   The likelihood function is L(µ, λ; x, y) = L(µ, x) × L(λ, y). Letting µ = θφ
and λ = φ(1 − θ), the likelihood function becomes

         L(θ, φ; x, y) = L(µ(θ, φ), x) × L(λ(θ, φ), y), where θ ∈ Θ, φ ∈ Φ.

    By the Bayes rule, the joint posterior density is

                                         L(θ, φ; x, y)π(θ, φ)
                   π(θ, φ | x, y) = R R                           ,
                                     Φ Θ
                                         L(θ, φ; x, y)π(θ, φ)dθdφ
i.e.,
                       π(θ, φ | x, y) ∝ L(θ, φ; x, y) × π(θ, φ).                   (10)
Marginalizing this last expression, we can obtain the posterior density of θ = A,
                                       Z
                         π(θ | x, y) =   π(θ, φ | x, y)dφ.                    (11)
                                          Φ



3.3. Bayesian estimation in an Exponential-Exponential
        System

    Consider a repairable system, where X = (X1 , . . . , Xn ) is a random sample
from the failure time with pdf f (x | µ) = µe−µx , x > 0, and Y = (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) is
a random sample from the repair time with pdf f (y | λ) = λe−λy , y > 0, m ≤ n.
                                                               1/µ
    In this case the limiting availability is given by A = (1/µ)+(1/λ)    λ
                                                                       = µ+λ .
    The likelihood function is

    In the following proposition, we show that if one considers the usual prior
Gamma for the parameters µ and λ, the Generalized Beta distribution is conju-
gated. Furthermore, Bayes estimator and credible interval for the limiting avail-
ability are computed.
Proposition 2. Suppose µ ∼ Gamma(a1 , b1 ), λ ∼ Gamma(a2 , b2 ), i.e., π(µ) ∝

3.4. Bayesian estimation in a Gamma-Exponential System

    Consider a repairable system, where X = (X1 , . . . , Xn ) is a random sample
from the failure time with pdf f (x | α, τ ) = Γ(α)τ 1
                                                        αx

                                                              e     , x > 0, and
Y = (Y1 , . . . , Ym ) is a random sample from the repair time with pdf f (y | λ) =
 1 −y/λ
λe      , y > 0, m ≤ n, where we suppose that α is known. In this case the
limiting availability is given by A = ατατ+λ .
   The likelihood function is

  L(τ, λ; α, x, y)
                                      n                n          m

   In the following proposition, we show that if one considers the usual inverse-
Gamma prior for the parameters τ and λ, the Generalized Beta distribution is
conjugated. Furthermore, Bayes estimator and credible interval for the limiting
availability are computed.

Proposition 3. Suppose        τ ∼ inverse − Gamma(c1 , d1 ), λ ∼ inverse −
Gamma(c2 , d2 ), i.e., π(τ ) ∝ µc1 −1 e−d1 µ , µ > 0, π(λ) ∝ λc2 −1 e−d2 λ , λ > 0 and, µ
and λ are independents. Then,

  (i) The prior distribution of A is a Generalized Beta distribution of parameters
      (c2 , c1 , d2 /d1 ), i.e., A ∼ GB3(c2 , c1 , d2 /d1 ).
 (ii) A | x, y ∼ GB3(c02 , c01 , d02 /d01 ), where c01 = c1 + nα, c02 = c2 + m, d01 =
      α(d1 + xi ) and d02 = d2 + yj .

3.5. Application and Simulation Study

    Analogously to the classical case, we consider two systems with the same char-
acteristics, where the times of the rst system follow exponential distributions. In
the other system, the failure time follows a Gamma distribution and the repair
time, an exponential law. The computational implementation considers the follow-
ing cases: conjugated informative priors, semi-informative priors, at conjugated
priors and non-informative priors.

      The parameters chosen for the simulations are presented in Table 5:

    In cases 1.1 and 1.2, the parameters of the prior distributions are interesting to
analyze. Cases 1.2 and 2.1 correspond to at priors. Case 2.2 is a semi-informative
prior. Cases 1.3 and 2.3 are informative priors, where the distribution is centred
on the true parameters.
    The distributions were simulated using R software version 3.4.1 (R Develop-
ment Core Team 2007), each Bayesian estimator was obtained over 1000 real-
izations and for dierent values of n and m. The estimators shown in Table 6
correspond to the average of the Bayesian estimators obtained on the 1000 rep-
etitions. Also, n corresponds to the sampled units from the failure times and m
from the repair times.

    In Table 6, the subscript of the Bayesian estimator are in relation to the prior
distribution used, for example if µ = 1.5 and λ = 1.5, and the estimate has
subscript 2, then the parameters of the prior correspond to case 1.2 of Table 5.
    We note that for the limiting availability A = 0.5, Bayesian estimators behave
quite well. However, when limit availability increases, a fairly light underesti-
mation is observed. The behavior of the estimate improves as the sample size
increases.

    Table 7 describes the mean of the standard deviations (sd) of the Bayesian
estimates of the limiting availability. We observe that standard deviations decrease
as prior distributions are more informative which is an expected behavior. Also,
the sample sizes have some inuence on the value of the standard deviations, but
this inuence is slight compared to the informative priors.
    The 95% credibility regions are reported in Table 8, using the same notation
as in Table 6. The length of the intervals tends to decrease as the sample size
increases or when the priors distributions are more informative. When the limit
availability is greater (A = 0.8209), the interval is more shifted to the left, this is
due to the asymmetry of the posterior distribution of the limiting availability.

    The parameters in Table 9 were chosen to study the behavior of the Bayesian
estimation of limiting availability. The cases 1.1 and 2.1 correspond to a less
informative prior, the cases 1.2 and 2.2 correspond to semi-informative priors and
the rest to very informative priors. As in the previous case, the simulations are
performed over 1000 repetitions for dierent values of m and n, where the resulting
estimator is the mean value of the 1000 Bayes estimators obtained. Table 10
summarizes the results of the estimates obtained.

   We note that the estimates closely resemble the true value of the limiting
availability. These estimates are more accurate as the sample size increases. The
standard deviations are presented in Table 11.
    The standard deviations are smaller when considered more informative priors,
in the non-informative case the dispersion is greater. In addition, if the sample
size increases the estimates are more accurate.

   The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is applied both for the failure times and for the
repair times considering the exponential distribution as the null hypothesis. This
was done using the SAS software Version[9.4] (SAS 2017), obtaining a p-value
greater than 0.5. So, the density functions of the failure time and the repair time
are considered as f (x | λ) = λe−λx , x > 0 and f (x | µ) = µe−µy , y > 0. Since we
do not have information about the parameters, it is possible to apply the results of
subsection 3.5.1, with non-informative priors. The posterior density of the limiting
availability is given by

5. Conclusions

    In the present work, the problem of estimating the limiting availability in a
single-component system is addressed under a Bayesian methodology. Also, the
maximum likelihood estimate is revisited.
    When implementing the maximum likelihood estimate, the behavior of the
estimators is consistent as the sample size is increased. Clearly, the convergence
of the estimator is aected by the dispersion of each variable.
   In the Bayesian case, the simulations were performed in a rather general way.
Exponential and Gamma distributions were considered for the failure time and
the repair time. The use of exponential and Gamma distributions for failure and
repair times has been motivated, taking into account the referential frame they
have in reliability. In addition, in our case, it is possible to perform a conjugate
analysis, taking as a priori the generalized Beta distribution. Furthermore, dier-
ent types of prior distributions for the hyperparameters were considered. In the
rst instance, priors providing little information and then others more informative.
Estimates of limiting availability greater than 0.5 are slightly underestimated in
both the classical and Bayesian cases when the failure time and the repair time
are exponential. However this does not occur, when the fault time is distributed
Gamma and the repair time, exponential.
   A relevant point of this work is to have developed a general Bayesian method-
ology, since this is not limited to the particular distributions considered.
    The Bayesian method is applied in the estimation of the limiting availability
of a palleitzer of a glass bottles factory, without having prior information. The
results reect the good performance of the machine.
   Extensions of this approach include the use of other loss functions, which
could help to control underestimation (respectively overestimation). In fact, the
Bayesian methodology developed and applied in this paper can be adapted to a co-
herent system of k independently functioning components. Also, other parametric
models used in reliability system can be considered.
    One interesting approach is to set up the reliability model treated in this paper
in a Bayesian semiparametric framework. This is a topic, for future research.
