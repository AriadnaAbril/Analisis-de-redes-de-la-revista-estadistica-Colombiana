1. Introduction
   Let U = {1, 2, . . . , i . . . , N } be a finite population, and y and x denote the
study variable and the auxiliary variableP                             xi respectively on
                                                  taking values yi and P

the ith unit (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ). Let Y = i=1 yi /N and X = i=1 xi /N be the
                                 N                                  N
population means, Sy2 = i=1 (yi − Y )2 /(N − 1) and Sx2 = i=1 (xi − X)2 /(N − 1)
                             P                                    P

                                                                       P

P x = i∈s
and
              2
  i∈s (xi − x) /(n − 1) the sample variances.
    In certain situations, estimation of population variance Sy2 has received consid-
erable attention from survey statisticians. For example, in manufacturing indus-
tries and pharmaceutical laboratories, sometimes the researchers are interested in
the variation of their products. Although, the literature describes a great vari-
ety of techniques for using auxiliary information by means of ratio, and product
and regression methods for estimating population mean, variance estimation us-
ing auxiliary information has received scarce attention. This is perhaps due to the
belief that the gain in efficiency we could obtain by involving an auxiliary variable
may not be too much relevant to motivate the use of more complex estimators.
However, some efforts in this direction are due to Das   Tripathi (1978), Isaki
(1983), Prasad   Singh (1990)(1992), Singh   Kataria (1990), Srivastava   Jhajj
(1980)(1995), Singh   Singh (2001), Ahmed, Walid   Ahmed (2003), Giiancarlo
& Chiara (2004), Jhajj, Sharma   Grover (2005), Kadilar   Cingi (2006)(2007)
and Grover (2007). Two notable estimators that are very much popular in the
literature are due to Isaki (1983) defined by
                                     ν1 = s2y Sx2 /s2x
and
                                 ν2 = s2y + b∗ (Sx2 − s2x )
where b∗ is an estimate of the regression coefficient of s2y on s2x defined by b∗ =
   s2y (λ−1)
        b
                             b = m22 /m20 m02 and βb2 (x) = m40 /m2 with mrs =

  i∈s (xi − x) (yi − y) /n [cf., Garcia   Cebrain (1996), and Kadilar   Cingi
(2006)].
    During the years that followed, much emphasis has been given on the prediction
of population mean or total [cf., Srivastava (1983)]. But, little interest has been
shown towards the prediction of the population variance. Under this approach,
the survey data at hand i.e., the sample observations are treated as fixed and
unassailable. Uncertainty is then attached only to the unobserved values which
need to be predicted. Bolfarine   Zacks (1992) indicated various techniques for
predicting population variance. Biradar   Singh (1998), using classical estimation
theory, provided some predictive estimators for Sy2 . In this paper, using auxiliary
variable x, we develop some more estimators under the prediction approach of
Basu (1971) with regards to a finite population setup.


2. Prediction Criterion
   Let us decompose U into two mutually exclusive domains s and r of n and
N − n units respectively, where r = U − s denotes the collection of units in U
which are not included in s. Then, under the usual prediction criterion given in
Bolfarine   Zacks (1992), it is possible to express
                                                 2
           (N − 1)Sy2 = (n − 1)s2y + (N − n − 1)Sy(r) + (1 − f )n(y − Y r )2 ,        (1)

Some Alternative Predictive Estimators of Population Variance                       511

                                                2
                                                    = i∈r (yi −Y r )2 /(N −n−1)
                          P                            P
where f = n/N , and Y r = i∈s yi /(N −n) and Sy(r)
are respectively the mean and variance of y-values belonging to r.
    Notice that the first component on the right hand side of (1) is known while the
second and third components are unknown. Hence, the prediction of (N − 1)Sy2
                   2
is possible when Sy(r)   and Y r are simultaneously predicted by some means from
the sample data. Using Vr and Mr as their respective predictors, a predictor of
Sy2 can be provided by the equation:

          (N − 1)Sby2 = (n − 1)s2y + (N − n − 1)Vr + (1 − f )n(y − Mr )2            (2)

    Most of the predictions are based either on distributional forms or an assumed
model [cf., Royall (1988), Bolfarine   Zacks (1992)]. However, Sampford (1978)
argued that the consideration of a model free prediction can generate a new, esti-
mator possessing some desirable properties. Basu (1971) also encouraged the use
of tools of the classical estimation theory to find out suitable predictors for Y .
Biradar   Singh (1998) formulated some estimators of Sy2 from (2) by considering
suitable choices of the predictors Vr and Mr in terms of the auxiliary
                                                                  P      variable x
under the tools of classical estimation theory. Defining X r = i∈r xi /(N − n)
      2
          = i∈r (xi − X r )2 /(N − n − 1), we report below their estimators along
             P
and Sx(r)
with the corresponding selections of Vr and Mr :
                                             
                                        N −2 2
                                 ν3 =            s
                                        N −1 y

when Vr = s2y and Mr = y,
                                                                     !
                        s2y       nN (x − X)2          y2    s2y
                    ν4 = 2 Sx2 +                         2 − s2

               2
when Vr = s2y Sx(r) /s2x and Mr = yX r /x, and
                                                                     !
                        s2y       nN (x − X)2                  s2y
                    ν5 = 2 Sx2 +                      b2yx −
                        sx       (N − n)(N − 1)                s2x

               2
when Vr = s2y Sx(r) /s2x and Mr = y + byx (X r − x), where byx = syx /s2x .
    Biradar   Singh (1998) also identified Isaki’s (1983) estimator ν1 as a special
                          2
case of (2) for Vr = s2y Sx(r) /s2x and Mr = y + sy (X r − x)/sx . This shows that the
estimator possesses a predictive character.


3. Some New Predictive Estimators of Sy2
    In the following discussions, we introduce some alternative approaches in order
to develop a few more predictive estimators of Sy2 .

  1. Consider the following alternative but equivalent representation of Sy2 :

                                                     2
                  (N − 1)Sy2 = (n − 1)s2y + (N − n)[σy(r) + f (y − Y r )2 ]              (3)

              2
                  = i∈r (yi − Y r )2 /(N − n). Denoting Vr∗ as a predictor of σy(r)2
                     P
      where σy(r)
      and Mr , as the predictor of Y r , the following alternative predictive equation
      can be considered:

                  (N − 1)Sy2 = (n − 1)s2y + (N − n)[Vr∗ + f (y − Mr )2 ]                 (4)

      Then, for Vr∗ =       n−1
                                   2
                             n     sy and Mr = y in (4) we get an estimator of Sy2
      defined by                                             
                                              n−1         N
                                   ν6 =                             s2y
                                               n         N −1

  2. Biradar   Singh (1998) developed the estimator ν5 from (2) with Vr =
           2
     s2y Sx(r) /s2x and Mr = y + byx (X r − x). See that in such an attempt Vr has
     been assumed a ratio version of the variance estimator while the connected
     mean estimator is a regression estimator. Hence as a matter of curiosity,
     we may also think in the light of Isaki (1983) to use a regression version of
     the variance estimator i.e., Vr = s2y + b∗ (Sx(r)
                                                    2
                                                        − s2x ) along with the mean
     estimator Mr = y + byx (X r − x) in the predictive equation (2) to predict
     Sy2 . This operation, after a considerable simplification, leads to produce the
     following estimator:
                                                              
                               N −2 2            N −1 2
                         ν7 =          sy + b∗         Sx − s2x
                               N −1              N −2

  3. Srivastava (1983) considered the predictive equation:

                                      Yb = f y + (1 − f )Mr                              (5)

      where Mr is the implied predictor of Y r , for predicting Y and shown that
      when Mr = yX r /x, Yb = y R = yX/x, the classical ratio estimator of Y , and
      when M = y +b (X −x), Yb = y = y +b (X −x), the classical regression
              r        yx     r                L          yx
      estimator of Y . Thus, both the ratio and regression estimators (y R and y L )
      of the mean possess a predictive character, the origin of which actually lies
      in predicting yi ’s, i ∈ r, by yi = yxi /x and yi = y + byx (xi − x) in that
      order. In view of this, we designate these two estimators as basic estimators
      of the population mean. Notice that the predictive estimators ν1 , ν4 , ν5 and
                                                                          2
      ν7 suggested so far have been obtained by using either Vr = s2y Sx(r)   /s2x or
             2    ∗   2       2
      Vr = sy + b (Sx(r) − sx ) as the case may be. This means that the unknown
                 2
      quantity Sy(r) is estimated as a whole with the same principle as that applied
      to estimate Y r . But, such a choice of Vr seems to be arbitrary by nature.
      Rather, we feel that it is more appropriate if the variance is established by

                                          Revista Colombiana de Estadística 35 (2012) 509–521

Some Alternative Predictive Estimators of Population Variance                             513

      predicting individual yi ’s, i ∈ r, for which we need to express Sy2 in the
      following form:
                                     X                 2
          (N − 1)Sy2 = (n − 1)s2y +     yi2 − (N − n)Y r + (1 − f )n(y − Y r )2 (6)
                                          i∈r


    A number P of new estimators can be easily generated from this equation on the
basis how i∈r yi2 is predicted. But, for simplicity, here we consider the prediction
of yi , i ∈ r, either by yi = yxi /x = y + y(xi − x)/x or by yi = y + byx (xi − x) and
prediction of Y r by yX r /x.
   Then, accordingly after a considerable simplification, we obtain the following
two new estimators:
                             "        2                    #

                ν8 =             s2y +                S 2 − s2x
                       N −1             x     n−1 x

                                                           
                                n−1       2    2    N −1 2   2
                     ν9 =                sy + byx       S − sx
                                N −1                n−1 x


4. Performance of the Proposed Estimators
    Out of the nine estimators considered or proposed in the preceding sections,
the estimators ν3 and ν6 were achieved without using any auxiliary information
whereas others were achieved through the use of information on the auxiliary
variable x. A desirable goal here is to study the performance of the proposed
estimators ν6 to ν9 compared to ν1 to ν5 at least in respect of bias and mean square
error (MSE) i.e., efficiency, where bias and MSE of an estimator νi of Sy2 are defined
respectively by B(νi ) = E(νi ) − Sy2 and M (νi ) = E(νi − Sy2 )2 (i = 1, 2, . . . , 9).
But, we see that some of the estimators are so complex that it is not possible to
derive exact expressions for their bias and MSE. Biradar   Singh (1998) presented
asymptotic expressions for these performance measures for the estimators ν1 to ν5 .
On the other hand, Nayak (2009) derived these expressions in favor of ν1 to ν9 .
But, the sufficient conditions for superiority of one estimator over other derived
by the authors using asymptotic expressions are so complicated that it is not
conducive to compare different estimators meaningfully. However, to facilitate
our comparison, these expressions are considered under the following widely used
linear regression model:

                                yi = βxi + ei , i = 1, 2, . . . , N                       (7)

where β(> 0) is the model parameter and ei is the error component such that
E(ei /xi ) = 0, E(e2i /xi ) = δxg (δ > 0, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1), and E(ei ej /xi , xj ) = 0 for i 6= j.
Further, we also assume that E(e4i /xi ) = ξxg and E(e3i /xi ) = E(e3i ej /xi , xj ) =
E(ei e3j /xi , xj ) = 0, (i 6= j). It may be pointed out here that the asymptotic
expressions for bias and MSE of different estimators under this assumed model
are derived through the Taylor linearization method.

4.1. Comparison of Bias
    After some algebraic manipulations (suppressed to save space), we get the
following model-based results in respect of the bias of different estimators up to
O(n−1 )


                        B(ν1 ) = CδE(xg )                                              (8)

                        B(ν3 ) = −      [β 2 Sx2 + δE(xg )]                           (10)

   In the light of the expressions (8) to (16), we state the following comments on
the bias of the estimators:

  (i) The regression estimator ν2 is model-unbiased, ν1 is positively biased and
      the rest seven estimators are negatively biased.
 (ii) |B(ν3 )| < |B(ν6 )|. This indicates that the bias of ν6 is always greater than
      that of ν3 .
 (iii) |B(ν8 )| < |B(ν7 )|i.e., ν8 is less biased than ν7 .
 (iv) |B(ν7 )| < |B(ν9 )|i.e., ν7 is less biased than ν9 .

Some Alternative Predictive Estimators of Population Variance                                  515

    In view of (iii) and (iv), although we can conclude that ν8 is less biased than ν7
and ν9 , we fail to obtain a clear-cut idea on the magnitude of bias of ν8 compared
to ν1 ,ν4 and ν5 . Because, comparison of (15) with (8) or (11) or (12) does not lead
to any meaningful conditions.


4.2. Comparison of Efficiency

estimators up to O(n−1 ) together with the exact expression for the variance of the

    From these expressions, as ν2 appears to be more efficient than s2y , ν1 , ν3 , ν4
and ν5 , we present the following results concerning efficiencies of the suggested
estimators:

 (ix) M (ν6 ) < M (ν3 ) < V (s2y ). This indicates that ν6 is more efficient than both
      s2y and ν3 .
 (x) M (ν7 ) = M (ν2 ) i.e., ν7 and ν2 are equally efficient even though they are
     configurationally different.
 (xi) ν8 is more efficient than ν2 when β 2 Sx2 < 21 which is very often satisfied
      in practice. This means that there is a scope to improve upon the Isaki’s
      regression estimator ν2 through ν8 .

       shows that ν8 is preferred to ν2 , ν7 and ν9 when the stated conditions are
       satisfied. The first condition is not a serious one. The second condition is
       easily satisfied for characters being measured in smaller magnitudes. We
       can also reduce the mean square error by considering transformations on the
       auxiliary variable and making the second condition more feasible.


4.3. Some Remarks
    From the previous model-based comparisons, we see that the proposed estima-
tor ν8 turns out to be more efficient than others. But no meaningful conclusion
could be drawn in favor of the four proposed estimators νi , i = 6, 7, 8, 9 in re-
spect of bias. This negative finding may be discouraging but not very decisive as
our comparisons are based on the asymptotic expressions derived through Tay-
lor linearization. However, as a counterpart to these analytical comparisons, we
do carry out a simulation study in the next section with an objective to exam-
ine the overall performance of the different variance estimators. The performance
measures of an estimator νi taken into consideration in this study are (i) Abso-
lute Relative Bias (ARB) = |B(νi )|/Sy2 , and (ii) Percentage Relative Efficiency
(P RE) = 100 × V (s2y )/M (νi ), (i = 1, 2, . . . , 9)


5. Description of the Simulation Study
    Our simulation study involves repeated draws of simple random (without re-
placement) samples from 20 natural populations described in Table 1. 2,000 inde-
pendent samples, for n = 6, 8 and 10, were selected from a population and for each
sample several estimators were calculated. Then, considering 2,000 such combina-
tions, simulated values of the performance measures were calculated and displayed
in Tables 2 and 3. To save space, the numerical values of the performance mea-
sures for n = 8 and 10 are not shown, but the results based on these values are
only reported. Major findings of the study are discussed in subsections 5.1 and
5.2.


5.1. Results Based on the ARB
    The numerical values on the ARB reveal that there is no definite pattern in the
performances of different estimators. The estimator ν1 possesses the least ARB
in 7 populations for n = 6 and in 6 populations for n = 8 and 10. ν8 is found to
have least ARB in 8, 10 and 11 populations for n = 6, 8 and 10 respectively. This
clearly indicates that the overall performance of ν8 improves with the increase in
sample size. Searching for an estimator as the third choice is difficult owing to
very erratic results in favor of the estimators (except ν1 and ν8 ).

5.2. Results Based on the PRE
     Results on the PRE of the competing estimators show that the estimator ν8 is
decidedly more efficient than the rest of the estimators in all populations for n = 6
and in 18 populations (except populations 1 and 17) for n = 8 and 10. Also the
efficiency gain due to this estimator is noticeably high. The estimator ν9 is found
to be the second best estimator being more efficient than others (except ν8 ) in 12
populations for n = 6 and in 10 populations for n = 8 and 10.

     Further, it is observed that both ν3 and ν6 i.e., the estimators exploiting no
auxiliary information, perform satisfactorily with ν6 being better than ν3 in all
populations. It may also be noted here that for n = 6, ν8 is the only estimator
using auxiliary variable x that is better than s2y in all populations. However, this
situation slightly changes with the increase in the sample size as it is worse than
s2y in one population for n = 8 and in two populations for n = 10. The estimators
ν1 ,ν2 , ν4 and ν5 do not fare well in most of the cases.

6. Conclusions
    Our model-assisted analytical and simulated studies lead to an overall con-
clusion that the estimator ν8 is preferable to others on the ground of efficiency.
Although the analytical comparison fails to conclude which estimator is decidedly
better than others on the ground of bias, the simulation study gives an indication
that on this ground ν8 is the better performer than other estimators. In view
of these findings, if computational difficulty is not a matter of great concern, the
variance estimator ν8 may be considered as the most suitable estimator. Of course,
these findings are only indicative and are no able to reveal essential features of the
comparable estimators in a straightforward manner. Further investigations in this
direction may be made for arriving at the conclusions.
