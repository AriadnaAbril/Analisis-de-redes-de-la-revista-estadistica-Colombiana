Abstract
In this paper, we develop some goodness of t tests for Rayleigh distribution based on Phi-divergence. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we compare the power of the proposed tests with some traditional goodness of t tests including Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling and Cramer von-Mises tests. The results indicate that the proposed tests perform well as compared with their competing tests in the literature. Finally, the new procedures are illustrated via two real data sets.
Key words : Goodness of t test, Monte Carlo simulation, Phi-divegence, Rayleigh distribution.

1. Introduction

     A continuous random variable X is said to have Rayleigh distribution with
location parameter Âµ âˆˆ R, and scale parameter Ïƒ > 0, denoted by X âˆ¼ Ra (Âµ, Ïƒ),
if its probability distribution function (pdf) is given by

                                                             x âˆ’ Âµ âˆ’ (xâˆ’Âµ)2

with the corresponding cumulative distribution function (cdf)

    It is evident from this gure that the Rayleigh distribution is right skewed, and
therefore it provides a useful tool for modelling right-skewed data. The Rayleigh
distribution was rstly motivated with a problem in acoustics, and has been uti-
lized for modelling the distribution of the distance between two individuals in a
Poisson process. This distribution typically arises when overall size of a vector is
related to its directional components. In fact, it is well-known that if Z and W are
two independent and identical random variables from    âˆš a standard normal distribu-
tion with mean zero and variance Ïƒ 2 , then X = Z 2 + W 2 follows a Rayleigh

distribution with location parameter Âµ = 0 and scale parameter Ïƒ . For more in-
formation about the applications and properties of the Rayleigh distribution, we
refer the interested reader to Siddiqui (1962) and Johnson, Kotz & Balakrishnan
(1994).
    This paper introduces some goodness of t tests for Rayleigh distribution when
the location parameter Âµ is known and the scale parameter Ïƒ is unknown. Without
loss of generality, throughout this paper we assume that Âµ is known to be zero.
If Âµ 6= 0, then one can simply apply the proposed procedures in this paper after
subtracting the parameter Âµ from data. Dey, Dey & Kundu (2014) discussed the
problem of estimating the parameters of Rayleigh distribution, and they proposed a
numerical method for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimators of the Rayleigh
parameters.
    In Section 2, we develop some goodness of t tests for Rayleigh distribution
based on Phi-divergence. We compare the proposed tests with some well-known
goodness of t tests for Rayleigh distribution via Monte Carlo simulation in Sec-
tion 3. We show that the proposed tests are generally more powerful than their
competitors in the literature. In Section 4, we illustrate the proposed procedures
by using two real data examples. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.


2. Tests of Fit for Rayleigh Distribution Based on
    Phi-Divergence

    Let P1 and P2 be two probability measures over measurable space â„¦. If P1
is absolutely continuous with respect to P2 , then Phi-divergence of P1 from P2 is
denoted by DÏ† (P1 ||P2 ) and is given by
                                       Z         
                                              dP1
                       DÏ† (P1 ||P2 ) =    Ï†         dP2 ,                     (3)
                                        â„¦     dP2
where Ï† (Â·) is a convex function such that Ï† (1) = 0 and Ï†00 (1) > 0.
   It is important to note that the Phi-divergence measure enjoys the non-negativity
and joint convexity properties. This means that DÏ† (P1 ||P2 ) â‰¥ 0 and the equality
happens if and only if P1 = P2 almost surely, and also for a xed Î³ âˆˆ [0, 1], we
have:
DÏ† (Î³P1 + (1 âˆ’ Î³) P1 ||Î³P2 + (1 âˆ’ Î³) P2 ) â‰¤ Î³DÏ† (P1 ||P2 ) + (1 âˆ’ Î³) DÏ† (P1 ||P2 ) ,
We refer the interested reader to Csiszar (1967), and Liese & Vajda (2006) and
references therein for more details about the Phi-divergence.
   Let f0 and f be the pdf under null and alternative hypotheses, respectively.
Some well-known divergence measures in statistics can be obtained by appropriate
choice of Ï†(Â·) function in (3) as follows:

goodness of t tests for normal, exponential, uniform and Laplace distributions.
    Let x1 , . . . , xn be a simple random sample of size n from the population of in-
terest with pdf f (x). Suppose that we are interested in testing the null hypothesis
H0 : f (x) = f0 (x, 0, Ïƒ) for some Ïƒ > 0, where f0 (x, 0, Ïƒ) is dened in (1) against
the alternative hypothesis H1 : f (x) 6= f0 (x, 0, Ïƒ) for all Ïƒ > 0. Let

be the sample estimate of D (f0 (x, 0, Ïƒ)||f (x)). Let fË†(x) be a nonparametric den-
sity estimator and ÏƒÌ‚ be an appropriate estimator of Ïƒ under H0 . Then
Dn f0 (x, 0, ÏƒÌ‚)||fË†(x) can be considered as a test statistic for testing H0 ver-
sus H1 , and the nullhypothesis H0 should be rejected for large enough values of
Dn f0 (x, 0, ÏƒÌ‚)||fË†(x) .
      We propose to estimate f (xi ) by using kernel density estimator, i.e.

the sample variance. We also replace the parameter Ïƒ by its maximum likelihood
estimator, i.e.
                                  v
                                  u      n

Therefore, the null hypothesis that the population distribution follows a Rayleigh
distribution is rejected if
                                      n

   In what follows, the test statistic obtained by using Ï†(Â·) function corresponding
to Kullback-Liebler, Hellinger, Jereys, Total variation and Chi-square distances
are denoted by KLn , Hn , Jn , T Vn and Ï‡2n , respectively.
    We also report the critical values of the proposed test statistics based on Monte
Carlo simulation at signicance level Î± = 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1. For this purpose, we
have generated 50,000 random samples from Rayleigh distribution with location
parameter Âµ = 0 and scale parameter Ïƒ = 1 using        VGAM   package of R statistical
software. We then estimated the (1 âˆ’ Î±) quantiles of the proposed test statistics
by using their (1 âˆ’ Î±) sample quantiles. It is important to note that all proposed
test statistics are invariant under scale transformation, and therefore the critical
values of the tests do not depend on the unknown parameter Ïƒ . The critical values
are reported in Table 1.
    Another way to estimate D (f0 (x, 0, Ïƒ)||f (x)) is to use spacing technique for
estimation of f (x). Alizadeh Noughabi, Alizadeh Noughabi & Ebrahimi Moghad-
dam Behdadi (2014) and Jahanshahi, Habibi Rad & Fakoor (2016) used this tech-
nique to develop a goodness of t test based for Rayleigh distribution based on
Kullback-Liebler and Hellinger distances, respectively. However, the drawback
of estimation of D (f0 (x, 0, Ïƒ)||f (x)) based on spacing is that it is not applicable
whenever there are ties in data. We also refer the interested reader to Mahdizadeh
(2012) and Zamanzade & Mahdizadeh (2017) for more information on this topic.


3. Power Comparison

   In this section, we compare the powers of the proposed tests with those of the
competitor tests in the literature. Let x(1) , . . . , x(n) be an ordered random sample
corresponding to simple random sample of x1 , . . . , xn . Let F0 (x, 0, Ïƒ) and ÏƒÌ‚ be as
dened in (2) and (5). The competing test statistics considered in this section are

All above tests reject the null hypothesis that the population distribution is Rayleigh
if their observed values are greater than the corresponding critical points at a given
signicance level.
    In order to compare the power of dierent goodness of t tests, we generated
50,000 simple random samples of sizes n = 10, 20 and 50 under 14 alternative
distributions considered by Best et al. (2010). We then estimated the power of
the aforementioned tests by dividing the number of test statistics values are greater
than their critical points at signicance level Î± = 0.05 to number of the repetitions
in the simulation study, i.e. 50,000. The alternative distributions as follows:

    The simulation results are presented in Tables 2-4. Table 2 presents the results
for sample size n = 10. It is clear from this table that none of the tests can
dominate the others in terms of power. However, the tests based on Jereys and
Hellinger distances have generally higher powers, and the dierence between their
performances is negligible in most considered cases. In fact, the Jn and Hn are
the most powerful tests for 8 out 14 alternative distributions considered in our
simulation study. The AD test also has good powers, and it is the best test when
the alternative distributions are W (3), G(1.5) and LN (0.8). It is worth noting that
all considered goodness of t tests have the highest powers for W (1) distribution
and the lowest powers for W (2) distribution, which is a special case of Rayleigh
distribution.

    Simulation results for sample size n = 20 are given in Table 3. The pattern of
the performance of goodness of t tests is somewhat similar to that of Table 2. The
highest possible power occurs when W (1) is the alternative distribution and the
lowest powers occur when W (2) is the alternative distribution. However, as one
expects, the powers for sample size n = 20 are higher than those for sample size
n = 10. We also observe that the tests based on Jereys and Hellinger distances
have the best performance, and they are the most powerful tests for 8 out of
12 considered alternative distributions. However, the tests based on KL and TV
distances and AD are the best tests in certain cases.
   Table 4 gives the simulation results for sample size n = 50. It is clear that the
powers in this table are higher than those in Tables 2-3.
    Finally, we would like to mention that W (2) distribution is a special case of
Rayleigh distribution. Therefore, it is clear from Tables 2-4 that all considered

4. Real Data Examples

    In this section, we applied our proposed procedures to two real data sets for
illustration purpose.

Example 1.     The data set used for this example is known as average wind speed
data (AWSD) and can be found in Best, Rayner & Thas (2010). The AWSD
includes 30 average daily wind speeds (in km/h) for the month of November 2007
recorded at Elanora Heights, a northeastern suburb of Sydney, Australia. The
data are as follows:

                            2.7, 3.2, 2.1, 4.8, 7.6, 4.7, 4.2, 4.0, 2.9, 2.9,
                           4.6, 4.8, 4.3, 4.6, 3.7, 2.4, 4.9, 4.0, 7.7, 10.0,
                            5.2, 2.6, 4.2, 3.6, 2.5, 3.3, 3.1, 3.7, 2.8, 4.0.

   Suppose that we are interested in testing the null hypothesis that the average
wind speed follows a Rayleigh distribution and we also assume that the location
parameter is known and Âµ = 1.5. Then, the estimated value of Ïƒ based on the
transformed data (after subtracting the location parameter) is given by ÏƒÌ‚ = 2.231.
The Q-Q plot and the corresponding histogram along with tted Rayleigh density
function is presented in Figure 2.

    The values of the proposed test statistics for Rayleigh distribution are KLn =
0.068, Hn = 0.009, Jn = 0.083, T Vn = 0.078, Ï‡2n = 0.016. Comparing above
test statistics values with their corresponding critical values at signicance level

Î± = 0.05 for sample size n = 30, we observe that the null hypothesis is not rejected.
This is consistent with what is reported by Best et al. (2010).

Example 2.    The second data set we use for illustrative purpose is survival times
for lung cancer patients (in days) which is collected by Lawless (1982). This data
set was also analyzed by Soliman & Al-Aboud (2008). The data are as follows:


                              6.96, 9.30, 6.96, 7.24, 9.30, 4.90, 8.42, 6.05,
                           10.18, 6.82, 8.58, 7.77, 11.94, 11.25, 12.94, 12.94.


    Here, we assume that the location parameter is known and equals to Âµ = 3.5
and we apply our procedures on after subtracting location parameter from them.
The estimated value of the parameter of Ïƒ is given by ÏƒÌ‚ = 3.499. Figure 3 shows
Q-Q plot and the corresponding histogram along with tted Rayleigh density for
this data set.

                                                                                  0.15

   The values of the proposed test statistics for Rayleigh distribution are KLn =
0.009, Hn = 0.003, Jn = 0.028, T Vn = 0.122, Ï‡2n = 0.013. On the other hand, the
simulated critical values for KLn , Hn , Jn , T Vn and Ï‡2n for n = 16 and Î± = 0.05
are 0.152, 0.020, 0.164, 0.329 and 0.072, respectively. Thus, the null hypothesis is
not rejected.

Goodness of Fit Tests for Rayleigh Distribution                                     289

5. Conclusion

   This paper deals with constructing goodness of t tests for Rayleigh distri-
bution based on Phi-divergence. Several goodness of t tests are proposed, and
their powers are compared with some well-known goodness of t tests based on
empirical distribution function. It is found that the introduced tests have good
performance as compared with their competitors.
