Abstract
In this paper, we consider two well-known methods for analysis of the Gini index, which are U-statistics and linearization for some income distributions. In addition, we evaluate two dierent methods for some properties of their proposed estimators. Also, we compare two methods with resampling techniques in approximating some properties of the Gini index. A simulation study shows that the linearization method performs 'well' compared to the Gini estimator based on U-statistics.    A brief study on real data supports our ndings.
Key words: Gini coecient, Income distribution, Linearization method, Resampling techniques, U-statistics.

1. Introduction
    The most common measure that economists and sociologists use is the Gini
index mainly because of clear economic interpretation. The Gini concentration
index has been estimated in dierent ways to obtain valid variance. The reliable
standard error is necessary to conduct statistical inference methods, in particular
to verify statistical hypothesis and construct condence intervals. The estimator of
this concentration coecient is usually non-linear, thus it's standard error cannot
be obtained easily. There are dierent methods of variance estimation for the Gini
coecient that can solve this problem. The Gini coecient can be obtained from a
simple ordinary least square regression based approach: see for instance Lerman &
Yitzhaki (1984), Shalit (1985), Ogwang (2000), Giles (2004, 2006) and Modarres &
Gastwirth (2006). Also, some authors have proposed the resampling techniques to
estimate the standard error of the Gini concentration index (see Yitzhaki (1991),
Mills & Zandvakili (1997), Berger (2008) and Yitzhaki & Schechtman (2013)).
    Another approach to variance estimation of the Gini index is the linearization
method. This way combines a range of techniques used to calculate the approxi-
mated variance of a non-linear statistic (here, the Gini index). It is based on the
rst-order Taylor expansion around a parameter and neglecting remaining term.
References based on this approximation to variance estimation of the Gini index
are such as Berger (2008), Davidson (2009), Langel & Tillé (2013) and Arcagni &
Porro (2014).
    The U-statistics as a unique frame for a class of statistic includes some popular
concentration indices. In income inequality study, we are dealing with estimators
that are U-statistic or functions of U-statistics. The theory of U-statistics states
that estimators that are included in U-statistics have a desirable asymptotic be-
havior with nice consistency properties. Among inequality indices, the Gini index
is a good applicant because its estimate can be viewed as functions of two simple
U-statistics. At rst Hoeding (1948) expressed the Gini index based on function
of two U-statistics and then studied its asymptotic properties. Since then, this
idea was pursued by authors such as Gastwirth (1971), Wolfe & Randles (1973),
Bishop, Formby & Zheng (1997), Xu (2007), Barrett & Donald (2009), Sering
(2009) and Yitzhaki & Schechtman (2013).
    Since comparison of the methods to obtain a reliable estimator for the Gini
index has been attention in economic and applied statistics, in the literature,
according to desirable properties of the U-statistics method, we evaluate and com-
pare this way with the linearization technique. Also, we examine some special
situations where the underlying distribution follows popular income distributions.
    In the next section, we discuss the concept of the Gini index which is the
popular income inequality measure. The main contributions of section 3 is to
present and compare some dierent approaches such as resampling techniques,
linearization method and U-statistics to variance estimation of the Gini index.
Section 4 provides simulation evidence that bears out the main conclusions of the
paper and compares some inferential statistics among these methods. Also, some
graphical comparisons have been done. In section 5, the results of the paper for

2. The Gini Coecient
    The most traditional member of the income inequality family is the Gini
coecient. It is widely used to measure income inequality, mainly because of
its intuitive geometric interpretation. This measure can be dened in various
ways (see Yitzhaki 1998 and Xu 2003). In general, the Gini index is a function
G : Rn + → [0, 1] that assigns to each non-negative income vector a real number
between 0 and 1, which represents the society's inequality level. This measure
is 0 in maximum equality and 1 in perfect inequality. The attractive denition
of the Gini index is as twice the area between the equality line and the Lorenz
curve in the unit box (as shown in Figure 1). The line at 450 represents perfect
equality of incomes and the area between this line and the Lorenz curve is called
concentration area. Therefore, the Gini index can be expressed as
                                                                                Z 1

   Using the denition of Gini index in equation (1), as twice the area between the
equality-line and the Lorenz curve, and applying a change of variable p = F (x), it
can be found that:
                                2 ∞
                                  Z

                                µ 0
(for more details see Xu 2003 and Davidson 2009).
   Suppose that an i.i.d sample of size n is drawn randomly from the population,
and F̂ denotes the corresponding empirical distribution function. Let X1 , . . . , Xn
be a random sample and X1:n ≤ · · · ≤ Xn:n be the order statistics obtained from
the sample. Then, an alternative estimator of the Gini coecient can be obtained
by plug-in empirical cdf (F̂ ) of income instead of its corresponding distribution
function F in (2), as:
                                 2 ∞

                           Ĝ =        xF̂ (x)dF̂ (x) − 1.                         (3)

      In this regard, the sample Gini index can be expressed as

    Davidson (2009) found an approximate expression for the bias of Ĝ from which
he derived the bias-corrected estimator of the Gini coecient, denoted G̃, which
is given by:
                                         n
                                  G̃ =       Ĝ,                              (5)
                                       n−1
while the estimator (5) is still biased but it's bias is of order n−1 . Sometimes using
this estimator is recommended because the properly bias corrected estimator is
not only even easier to compute rather than the other estimators but also its bias
converges to 0 faster as n → ∞.


3. Variance Estimation of the Gini Index
    The computation of standard error of the Gini index has been subject to nu-
merous publications. Dierent approaches with complicated formula to variance
estimation of the Gini index have prompted a great amount of research in statistics
and economics. The main contributions of this section is to present and compare
some dierent approaches to variance estimation of the Gini index.

     niques used to calculate the approximated variance of a non-linear statistic.
     It consists of approximating a non linear or complex statistic (here, the Gini

     and the Gini index are discussed. Suppose X1 , . . . , Xn be i.i.d random vari-

     variables, called the kernel for θ.
     For any kernel h, the corresponding U-statistic for estimating of θ on the

      estimator of θ.
      Here, we use the results from U-statistics (Hoeding 1948) to derive the
      inferential statistics of Gini inequality index. The well known Gini coecient
      can be expressed in terms of statistical functionals as, G = 2µ   ∆
                                                                          , where ∆ =

      By using Hoeding's theorem (1948), which concerns the joint distribution of
      several U-statistics, the U-statistics U1 and U2 are consistent estimators for
      two parameters θ1 = µ and θ2 = ∆ and the joint asymptotic distribution of
      U1 and U2 is a bivariate normal distribution. If distribution F is continuous
      and has a nite variance, then, the joint distribution of two U-statistics is

   • Resampling techniques. The most of the formulations of the variance for
     the Gini index are mathematically complex. To avoid these mathematical
     diculties, some authors have proposed using the resampling techniques such
     as bootstrap and jackknife methods. Resampling methods treat an observed
     sample as a nite population and random samples are generated from it to
     estimate population characteristics and make inferences about the sampled
     population.
     The bootstrap method is a class of Monte Carlo method that estimate the
     distribution of a population by resampling. The term bootstrap can refer to
     nonparametric or parametric bootstrap. Monte Carlo methods that involve
     sampling from a fully specied probability distribution are called parametric
     bootstrap. In nonparametric bootstrap, the distribution is not specied and
     the distribution of the nite population represented by the sample can be
     regarded as a pseudo population. By repeatedly generating random samples
     from this pseudo population, the sampling distribution of a statistic can be
     estimated.
     Suppose G is the parameter of interest and Ĝ is an estimator of G. Then the
     bootstrap estimate of distribution of Ĝ is obtained as follows:

        i) Given a sample X1 , . . . , Xn of size n and an estimate of Ĝ.
       ii) Draw M bootstrap samples of size n with replacement from X1 , . . . , Xn .
       iii) Calculate the estimator for each one of them and obtain M values of
            the estimator, denoted by Ĝ∗1 , . . . , Ĝ∗M .

      Then, these values are used in order to estimate the variance of the orig-
      inal estimator. Namely, the sample variance of Ĝ∗1 , . . . , Ĝ∗M is used as the
      bootstrap variance estimator of the variance of the original statistic. The
      bootstrap standard error of Ĝ can then be estimated as:
                                      v
                                      u          M
                                      u     1   X             2

                      m=1
      The jackknife is another resampling method for estimating bias and stan-
      dard error of an estimator when standard methods for computing bias and
      variance cannot be applied or are dicult to apply. Suppose that Ĝ is an
      estimator of the Gini coecient (G) based on plug-in estimator in (4). If
      we denote by Ĝ(i) the Gini estimator for the subsample of the initial sample
      where the ith observation has been deleted, then the jackknife estimator for
      measuring the Gini coecient based on the n values of Ĝ(i) is dened as
      (Knight 1999)
                                               n
                                        n−1X
                             ĜJ = Ĝ +           (Ĝ − Ĝ(i) ),                (8)
                                         n i=1

      The jackknife technique can also be used to variance estimation of the Gini
      estimator. Yitzhaki (1991) proposed the standard error of the Gini index
      with the jackknife method in the following form:
                                  v
                                  u         n
                                  un − 1 X
                            σ̂J = t            (Ĝ(i) − Ĝ• )2 ,              (9)
                                       n i=1

      where
                                                n
                                            1 X (i)
                                      Ĝ• =       Ĝ .
                                            n i=1


4. Simulation Study
    In this part of the literature, we carried out a simulation study to comparison
the performance of the Gini estimators. We compare the U-statistic estimator
with linearization estimator (which proposed by Davidson 2009) in terms of bias
and MSE. To nd the bias and the MSE, 10,000 estimate of Gini index is obtained
by taking the sample size 10, 20, 30, 50, 70 and 100. It is notable that the results
is directly applicable to any other sample size. Also, the number of replications is
a stopping criteria to access the reliable inferences.
   In our study, we rst generate random sample from the exponential distribution
with cdf F (x) = 1 − e−x , x > 0. Note that the true value of the Gini index for

this distribution is 0.5. It is interesting to see that the estimator based on U-
statistics has less bias and more MSE compared to the linearization estimator. So
the linearization estimator perform better. The comparison results are given in

    It is evident that the two estimators are aected by negative bias, that is,
they underestimate the value of the index. Also, it is possible to see that the
linearization method has better performance, in particular for small samples.

are shown in Figure 2 for n = 10, 100. It can be noted that, even for a very
small sample size, the asymptotic standard normal approximation of linearization
estimator in exponential distribution is high.

    The Pareto distribution is considered as the best model for income data as it
capture heavy tail behavior. For our study consider Pareto distribution with cdf
F (x) = 1 − x−λ , x ≥ 1 , λ > 1. The true value of the Gini index is 2λ−1
                                                                        1

corresponding results are given in Table 2.
   For dierent values of λ and for n = 10, 100, the MSE and bias are given in
Table 3 and 4. The bias of U-statistic is less than of linearization estimator but
MSE is more.

   In using a hypothesis test and condence interval, it is important to have a
correct method available for computing the standard error of the Gini coecient.
So, in this regard, Figure 3 compares the variance estimation of the two methods
under Pareto distribution with n = 100. This Figure shows that how the variance
of Gini index varies with parameter λ. It is evident that for values of λ greater
than about 50 there is no signicant dierence between variance estimation of the
two ways.
    Finally we compare two estimators when the sample come from Loglogistic
(LL) distribution as one of the simplest form of the generalized beta distribution
of second kind (GB2) with cdf

                                                1
                               F (x) = 1 −          ,     a > 0,
                                             1 + xa

where a > 0 is the shape parameter. In this distribution family, the true value of
the Gini estimator is a1 . The comparison results are shown in Table 5.
    For dierent values of a and n = 100, MSE and bias are also given in Table 6.
It can be noted that the sample Gini index, however, is not remarkable biased for
any value of a considered.

noted that for values of a greater than about 50 the distribution does not change

    Here, we refer to some evidence about the behaviour of the bootstrap. In Table
7, coverage probabilities (C.P) and average sizes (A.S) of t-bootstrap condence
intervals (see Mills & Zandvakili 1997) are given for n = 100 and for nominal
condence levels % 90, % 95 and % 99. Apart from the expected serious distortions

when a = 2, the coverage rate of these condence intervals is remarkably close to
nominal. It seems that, unless the tails are very heavy, the bootstrap can yield
acceptably reliable inference.

    We end this section with comparison the greatest absolute deviation of the
empirical distribution of Gini standardized statistics from standard normal. Ta-
ble 8 explains the divergence from normal distribution for the lineariazation, U-
statistics, jackknife and bootstrap estimators under exponential distribution as a
benchmark.
   It can be seen that the lineariazation method does a very good job of the
divergence from normal distribution. The lineariazation estimator has desirable
asymptotic properties. Generally the two resampling methods provide similar
results.

    Figure 5 shows relative frequency histograms obtained on the basis of simulated
10,000 samples (simple random sampling design without replacement) of size n =
100 from the Austrian income data and estimated both indices in each sample.
The histograms are accompanied by tted normal density curves. It is evident that
for the two Gini estimators, the consistency with the normal distribution is high.
This intuition is conrmed by a small simulation study performed to estimate the
skewness and excess kurtosis of the sampling distribution of both indices.

   Here, we have performed an analysis on comparison the Bias and MSE of the
two Gini estimates in tted distribution to real data. For better interpretation,
the results have been shown in Figure 7. This gure shows that the two estimators
underestimate the value of the index. The bias of the linearization method is bigger
than of the U-statistic that seem to be asymptotically unbiased. Considering the
accuracy of the estimators through the value of the MSE, it is possible to see that
the linearization method has better performance, in particular for small samples.

6. Conclusion
   In this paper, we consider two well-known methods for analysis of the Gini
index, which are U-statistics and linearization for some inequality distributions.
In these distributions, in addition, we evaluate two dierent methods for some
properties of their estimators. Also via some gures, we compare the two methods
with jackknife technique in approximating variance and convergence rate of the
Gini estimator. Overall, in this note, the results are all favor of linearization
method compared to U-statistic technique. Also, a brief study on real data income
supports our ndings.
