Abstract
In this paper, we describe how the pathfinder algorithm converts relatedness ratings of concept pairs to concept maps; we also present how this algorithm has been used to develop the Concept Maps for Learning website (www.conceptmapsforlearning.com) based on the principles of effective formative assessment. The pathfinder networks, one of the network representation tools, claim to help more students memorize and recall the relations between concepts than spatial representation tools (such as MultiDimensional Scaling). Therefore, the pathfinder networks have been used in various studies on knowledge structures, including identifying students’ misconceptions. To accomplish this, each student’s knowledge map and the expert knowledge map are compared via the pathfinder software, and the differences between these maps are highlighted. After misconceptions are identified, the pathfinder software fails to provide any feedback on these misconceptions. To overcome this weakness, we have been developing a mobile-based concept mapping tool providing visual, textual and remedial feedback (ex. videos, website links and applets) on the concept relations. This information is then placed on the expert concept map, but not on the student’s concept map. Additionally, students are asked to note what they understand from given feedback, and given the opportunity to revise their knowledge maps after receiving various types of feedback.
Key words: Concept Maps, Effective Feedback, Pathfinder Network, Structural Assessment.
Resumen
En este artículo se describe cómo el algoritmo de búsqueda de ruta convierte puntajes de conceptos pareados en mapas conceptuales. También se presenta cómo este algoritmo ha sido utilizado para desarrollar estos mapas conceptuales para aprendizaje (www.conceptmapsforlearning.com) basados en los principios del aseguramiento formativo efectivo. Las redes de búsqueda de ruta, una de las herramientas de representación de redes, ayudan a memorizar a los estudiantes y enunciar las relaciones entre mapas más que las herramientas de expresión espacial (tales como el escalonamiento multidimensional). Por tanto, las redes de búsqueda de rutas han sido usadas en varios estudios de estructura del conocimiento incluyendo la identificación de malos conceptos usados por los estudiantes. Para lograr esto, cada mapa de conocimiento tanto del estudiante como del experto son comparados vía el software de búsqueda de ruta y se remarcan las diferencias entre éstos. Después que los malos conceptos son identificados, el software de búsqueda falla en entregar una retroalimentación en estos nodos conceptuales. Para superar esta debilidad, se desarrolla una herramienta de mapa conceptual móvil que manda retroalimentaciones visuales, textuales y remediales (e.g. vídeos, enlaces a páginas web y applets) en las relaciones de los conceptos. Adicionalmente, los estudiantes son preguntados acerca de qué entienden de la retroalimentación brindada y se les da la oportunidad de revisar sus mapas de conocimiento después de recibir varios tipos de retroalimentación.
Palabras clave: aseguramiento estructural, mapas conceptuales, redes de bśqueda de ruta, retroalimentación efectiva.



1. Introduction
    The most important factor in learning is to identify learners’ existing knowl-
edge. Meaningful learning relies on how well connections are made between what
is known and what is still to be known (Ausubel 1978). This prior knowledge can
be presented either spatially or non-spatially via digital knowledge mapping tools
(Figure 1).
    In spatial models (e.g., Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)), concepts are placed
(based on distance) in a geometric space of continuous attributes or dimensions.
In contrast, concepts are located based on the presence or absence of shared dis-
crete attributes in non-spatial models (e.g., Pathfinder Network Representation)
(Cooke 1992b). As compared to MDS, Pathfinder Network Representation has
several advantages. First, concepts do not need to be placed hierarchically in
Pathfinder Network Representation (Cooke 1992b). Second, asymmetrical rela-
tionships among concepts can be visualized via Pathfinder Network Representa-
tion (Cooke 1992b). Third, Pathfinder Network Representation better captures
information related to recall than MDS (Cooke, Durso & Schvaneveldt 1986).
Finally, and most importantly, while MDS illustrates global relations among con-
cepts, Pathfinder Network Presentation demonstrates local relations among con-
cepts (Cooke & Schvaneveldt 1988, Chen 2004). Due to these strengths, Pathfinder

Network Representation may provide a better approach to identifying students’
specific incomplete understandings, including their misconceptions, than MDS.
Therefore, Pathfinder Network Representation was chosen as the basis for visu-
alizing students’ knowledge in the mobile structural assessment tool discussed in
this paper.


2. Pathfinder Software and Structural Assessment
   Pathfinder software generates network representations, which consist of nodes
and lines, based on obtained proximity data. Networks generated by Pathfinder
are similar to concept maps without linking terms; nodes and lines in the net-
works correspond to concepts and relationships, respectively. Therefore, networks
produced by Pathfinder will be referred to as knowledge maps.
    Structural assessment using Pathfinder involves three basic steps: obtaining
proximity data from a student, converting these data into a knowledge map, and
comparing the student’s knowledge map with an expert knowledge map (Goldsmith,
Johnson & Acton 1991, Taricani & Clariana 2006, Kim 2012). In this regard, we
first reveal different ways of collecting proximity data. Then, how these data are
converted to a knowledge map via the Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm is illustrated.
Thereafter, criteria for generating ideal expert knowledge maps are identified. Fi-
nally, a brief literature review is given for demonstrating the ways that students’
knowledge maps are evaluated using expert knowledge maps.


2.1. Obtaining Proximity Data
   Two approaches are used for collecting proximity data to create students’
knowledge maps via the Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm. In the first approach, stu-


                                                                        Revista Colombiana de Estadística 37 (2014) 297–317

dents are given a set of concepts, and then asked to consider concept associations
for sorting the concepts, making an ordered recall or rating the degree of related-
ness of concept pairs. Among these tasks, performing pairwise ratings has been
shown to be superior to the alternative tasks (Rowe, Cooke, Hall & Halgren 1996).
    In the second approach to obtaining proximity data, students are asked to pre-
pare a document (e.g., write an essay) without a predefined set of concepts (Chen
2011, Cooke, Neville & Rowe 1996, Davis, Curtis & Tschetter 2003, DeChurch &
Mesmer-Magnus 2010, Goldsmith et al. 1991). Proximity data can then be com-
puted from the document using the Analysis of Lexical Aggregates (ALA-Reader)
software (Koul, Clariana & Salehi 2005). ALA-Reader requires teachers to create
a set of concepts (maximum of 30 words) consisting of important terms and their
synonyms and metonyms. Afterwards, this concept set and students’ essays are
submitted to the software for converting the co-occurrences of terms into proposi-
tions. Finally, these propositions are compiled across all sentences into a proximity
array. Studies have shown that the grades given by ALA-Reader are moderately
consistent with those given by human evaluators (Clariana & Koul 2004, Koul
et al. 2005, Clariana & Wallace 2007). On the other hand, this technique has
some limitations. First, Kim (2013) points out that ALA-Reader cannot extract
information about why two linked concepts are related. In addition, Gomez, Had-
field & Housner (1996) argue that the pairwise ratings task is a more direct ap-
proach to capturing knowledge structures than essay writing, because students
are required to think about every possible concept relationship while performing
pairwise ratings. Consistent with Gomez et al. (1996)’s argument, Boring (2005)
found that knowledge structures of students in an introductory physiology course
derived from a pairwise rating task were more coherent than when derived from
essays.


2.2. How the Pathfinder Algorithm Works
    The Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm determines whether two concepts are linked
through the triangle inequality (Cooke 1992b, Guerrero-Bote, Zapico-Alonso, Esi-
nosa-Calvo, Gomez-Crisostomo & Moya-Anegon 2006, Nash & Nash 2003). This
algorithm has two parameters. The parameter r is related to the Minkowski
metric which is used for calculating indirect path distances between two concepts,
and its value can be between 1 and infinity (Kivlighan & Tibbits 2012, Nash &
Nash 2003, Schvaneveldt 1990). While the city block metric is computed when r is
equal to 1, the length of an indirect path equals the maximum weight of the links
that create the path when r is set as infinity, (Cooke 1992b, Nash & Nash 2003).
The other parameter, q, determines the maximum number of links in examining
any path, and this parameter could be set from 1 to the number of nodes minus one
(Cooke 1992b, Kivlighan & Tibbits 2012, Nash & Nash 2003, Schvaneveldt 1990).
After both parameters are set, two concepts are assigned to be linked if the length
of any indirect path is equal to or longer than the length of the link between these
two concepts (Nash & Nash 2003).
   When the value of r or q is increased, the number of the links in a network
might be decreased (Chen 1998, Nash & Nash 2003). Therefore, r and q set to

infinity and n-1 (n referring to the number of concepts), respectively, will create
the most parsimonious network having the least number of links (Chen 1998,
Cooke 1992b, Guerrero-Bote, Zapico-Alonso, Espinosa-Calvo, Gomez-Crisostomo
& Moya-Anegon 2006, Kivlighan & Tibbits 2012, Nash & Nash 2003). An example
of how the Pathfinder algorithm works under such conditions is demonstrated next.
   Pathfinder creates a knowledge map from pairwise ratings in six steps. These
steps are illustrated via the following example ratings (see Table 1) from Trum-
power & Sarwar (2010).

                        Table 1: An example of pairwise ratings.

  1. A matrix (see Table 2) is created by using the ratings above.

  2. The ratings in the matrix above are recoded because there is a reverse re-
     lationship between the relatedness degree of concept pairs and the distance
     between them (1→5, 2→4, 3→3, 4→2, 5→1).

  3. W 3 is created. In order to do this, first W 2 must be calculated. The
     equation (1) is used for calculating each element of W 2 .

                                  q                 q−1 r 1/r
                                 wjk = ((wjm )r + (wmk ) )                             (1)

     For r =∞, the result of the equation above is equal to max(wjm , wq−1
                                                                       mk ) (Ichino
     & Yaguchi 1994). In this equation, j, k, and m are the indexes representing
     the order of concepts in the set. For instance, j and k equal to 1 and 2,


                                        Revista Colombiana de Estadística 37 (2014) 297–317

302                                     Mehmet Filiz, David Trumpower & Arun Vanapalli


      respectively, when that equation is for computing value of the element for
      Milk and Barn concepts. In addition, m can be 3 or 4 because there are
      four concepts in the set and it cannot be equal to j and k. Thus, W 212 is
      computed as shown below.
      r → ∞ w212 = ((w13 ) r + (w32 ) r )1/r =((1) r + (2) r ) 1/r =2
      r → ∞ w212 = ((w14 ) r + (w42 ) r )1/r =((5) r + (3) r )1/r =5
      Therefore, W 212 is equal to 2, because it is equal to minimum value of W 212 ’s.

     compared elements are equal, the value of the corresponding element in ma-
     trix L is “1” which indicates a link between two concepts. If two compared
     elements are not equal, the value of the corresponding element in matrix L
     is “0” which reveals that two concepts are not directly related.

2.3. Criteria for Generating Referent Knowledge Maps
    Creating referent knowledge maps, which best reflect the structure of a particu-
lar topic, is one of the essential components of the Pathfinder structural assessment
technique, because these maps are used for evaluating students’ knowledge maps
(Acton, Johnson & Goldsmith 1994, Cooke 1999). Therefore, a few criteria should
be set for generating valid referent knowledge maps, including limiting the number
of concepts in the concept list, and testing the accuracy of expert ratings.
    First, the number of concepts in a knowledge map should be limited even
though Goldsmith et al. (1991) claim that the greater the number of concepts in
a set, the more accurate the knowledge network. Goldsmith et al. (1991) used
a set of 30 concepts in their study, and each student spent approximately one
hour to complete the pairwise ratings task. Consequently, having more concepts
in a knowledge map results in time-consuming pairwise ratings tasks, and this
might draw students’ attention away from said task (Dicerbo 2007). Trumpower
& Sarwar (2010), therefore, suggest that the set of concepts should consist of at
most around 20 concepts, whereas Casas-García & Luengo-González (2013) claim
that there should be no more than 12 concepts in the set. On the other hand,
Cooke (1999) and Goldsmith et al. (1991) argue that a set must include at least
12 concepts to accurately assess a domain. Thus, it appears that a set of concepts
should consist of around 12 concepts to provide an accurate measure of a domain.
However, a few studies have shown that less than 12 concepts might be enough to
accurately assess a topic if there are core concepts confirmed by domain experts.
For instance, Trumpower & Sarwar (2010) used 11 concepts of a unit on work,
energy, and power to capture students’ conceptual understanding before and after a
feedback/remediation activity. After 24 high school students rated the relatedness
degree of these concept pairs before and after the feedback/remediation activity,
their pre and post knowledge maps were generated. Then, the similarity indexes


                                    Revista Colombiana de Estadística 37 (2014) 297–317

Concept Maps for Learning Website                                                   305

for their pre and post knowledge maps were calculated by comparing them with
the expert knowledge map. The mean of the similarity values rose from 0.45 (SD
= 0.11) to 0.56 (SD = 0.12), and this increase was significant (F (1, 23) = 17.04;
p < 0.0001). Likewise, Casas-García & Luengo-González (2013) created a set of 11
concepts for generating students’ knowledge maps on the mathematical concept of
angles. Primary (Grade 3P to 6P), Secondary (Grade 1E to 4E), Olympiad (2E),
and Mathematics Undergraduate students were asked to perform the pairwise
ratings of these concepts. Then, the representative knowledge map of each group
was created and compared to each other for computing similarity indexes between
the knowledge maps. Thereafter, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, and it was
found that the similarity between the knowledge maps increased with rising age
and experience of the students (H = 15.252, 7 d.f., p = 0.0329). Additionally,
Boring (2005) identified 10 core concepts of an introductory psychology course to
compare students’ essay scores (g), which are given by the human graders (holistic
and analytic) and the computerized grader, with Pathfinder similarity index (C ).
For the holistic graders, g = 0.414C - 0.048, where R2 = 0.001 and p > 0.05.
Therefore, the degree of Pathfinder network similarity was not a good indicator
of the grade awarded by the holistic graders. Similarly, it was found that the
relationship between the Pathfinder network similarities and the score awarded
by the analytic graders was not significant (R2 = 0.012 and p > 0.05). On the
other hand, the degree of similarity between the computerized grader’s Pathfinder
network and the student essay writer’s network was a reasonably good indicator
of the grade awarded for that paper (R2 = 0.247 and p = 0.06). In these studies,
although the researchers used less than 12 concepts, they assumed that generated
knowledge maps were valid measures of students’ understanding. Furthermore,
at least three experts should be asked to rate the relatedness degree of concept
pairs; then, the mean of their ratings should be calculated for each concept pair
to create more valid expert knowledge maps (Wilson 1998, Day, Arthur Jr &
Gettman 2001, Sarwar 2012, Kivlighan & Tibbits 2012). However, some studies
reveal that expert ratings may not be consistently accurate for several reasons.
These reasons include having different types of domain expertise or teaching at
different levels. For instance, Moni, Beswick & Moni (2005) asked two experts
(an experienced physiologist and a pharmacologist) to score concept maps related
to physiology, and found that there were larger differences between their scores
for some of these concept maps. Moreover, Von Minden, Walls & Nardi (1998)
concluded that the knowledge maps of elementary school mathematics teachers
showed strongest agreement with high school teachers and weakest agreement with
university mathematicians. Thus, not all expertise is equal. When creating a
referent knowledge map from the mean ratings of several experts, such inequalities
must be taken into account. Sarwar (2012) provides an example of how to deal with
differences and inaccuracies in expert ratings by determining the reliability within
each expert rating and the reliability across experts’ ratings. For the reliability
within each expert’s set of ratings (i.e., test-retest reliability), experts were asked
to rate the relatedness degree of all concept pairs and, in addition, the first five
concept pairs were repeated at the end of the survey. For example, if there are six
concepts in a set, the number of possible concept pairs is 15. In addition to these

pairs, the first five pairs are repeated so there are 20 concept pairs (see Figure 4).
Thus, the test-retest reliability of the ratings of the first five and last five pairs for
each expert can be computed.




                      Figure 4: An example of response format.

    As well, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between each pair of
experts’ set of ratings to measure how consistent the experts were (i.e., inter-
rater reliability). Following the calculation of these two measures of reliability, the
author eliminated any expert’s ratings that did not show acceptable test-retest
reliability or that did not correlate well with the other experts’ ratings. A cut-
off value of .50 was used in both cases. After these two reliability checks, the
average value of the remaining experts’ ratings for each concept pair was used to
generate the referent knowledge map. In summary, reliability within each expert’s
ratings as well as high correlation across expert ratings is crucial for generating
accurate expert knowledge maps. In conclusion, limiting the number of concepts
in the concept list and testing the reliability of expert ratings are basic criteria for
generating ideal expert knowledge maps.


2.4. Brief Review of Studies on Pathfinder Networks
   When a student’s knowledge map is compared with an expert knowledge map
through Pathfinder software, three different measures (PRX, GTD and C) are
computed. PRX demonstrates the correlation of raw proximities whereas GTD


                                       Revista Colombiana de Estadística 37 (2014) 297–317

(graph-theoretic distance) illustrates the correlation of the distances between the
nodes in two knowledge maps (Lau & Yuen 2010). C (configural similarity) is
computed by dividing the number of common links in two knowledge maps by
the total number of links in both knowledge maps (Clariana 2010). Among these
measures, C is most commonly used.
    McGaghie, McCrimmon, Mitchell, Thompson & Ravitch (2000) examined the
correlation between the configural similarities of students’ knowledge maps with
their examination performances. In this study, 153 Northwestern University medi-
cal students and 76 University of Wisconsin veterinary medical students were asked
to perform pairwise ratings of 12 concepts before a three-week-long instructional
unit on pulmonary physiology. After this instruction, students took an examina-
tion and rated the relatedness degree of the same 12 concepts again. Then, the
configural similarities of students’ pre-knowledge maps and post-knowledge maps
with an expert knowledge map were computed. They found that students’ knowl-
edge maps became more similar to the expert knowledge map following instruction,
increasing from .07 to .22 for the Northwestern University students and from .12
to .18 for the University of Wisconsin students. The authors also noted, however,
that the correlation between the configural similarity of students’ post-knowledge
maps with the expert knowledge map, and their examination performance, was not
statistically significant at the p = .05 level. The reason behind this unexpected
result may be the difference between the type of knowledge measured by configural
similarity and the examination (see, for example, Taricani & Clariana 2006).
    Comparison of students’ knowledge maps with an expert knowledge map based
on the presence and absence of concept relations may provide further information
about students’ knowledge, such as their incomplete understanding and/or miscon-
ceptions. Dicerbo (2007) compared a student map (utilizing the mean of several
students’ results) with an expert knowledge map and identified how experts’ knowl-
edge organization differs from students’ knowledge organization. In this study, 156
students and 12 teachers were asked to perform a relatedness task of two sets of
concepts prior to instruction. One set represented the course as a whole, whereas
the other consisted of concepts from a specific chapter (Networking Fundamentals)
within a course. These ratings were then submitted to the Pathfinder software to
generate the knowledge maps of the students and experts as well as to find the C
index between them. While the C index between students’ knowledge map and
experts’ knowledge map was .27 for the set of concepts representing the entire
course, the C index between students’ knowledge map and experts’ knowledge
map was .23 for the concepts of Networking Fundamentals. Furthermore, the ex-
pert map for the concept set representing the course as a whole corresponded to
the Open System Interconnections model, whereas the tendency of students was
to categorize concepts as equipment and words that sounded similar. Addition-
ally, while experts organized the concepts of Networking Fundamentals by network
type (local “LAN ” or wide-area “WAN ”), students categorized these concepts in
a device-centric organization (Figure 5). Even though this study might give some
clues to teachers for targeting their instruction, it does not provide any information
regarding individual students’ understandings of particular concept relations.

    Similarly, Boldt (2001) compared a knowledge map of introductory financial
accounting students and a knowledge map of Masters-level students with an ex-
pert knowledge map. First, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were
calculated for each student’s ratings with every other student’s ratings. Then, the
mean coefficients of relatedness ratings between students group were computed.
It was found that the knowledge map of the Masters-level students was more sim-
ilar to the expert knowledge map (.48) as compared to the knowledge map of the
introductory financial accounting students (.20). In addition, the concepts in the
knowledge map of the Masters students and introductory financial accounting stu-
dents were classified into four categories as well-defined, misdefined, overdefined
and underdefined. A well-defined concept refers to any concept which is linked to
the same concepts in both the student knowledge map and the expert knowledge
map. The concept is misdefined if there are no common links between the stu-
dent knowledge maps and the expert knowledge map, yet it has extraneous links
which are not present in the expert knowledge map. Overdefined concepts have
both all present links in the expert knowledge map and some extraneous links. In
contrast, underdefined concepts in a student knowledge map only have some of
the links which are present in the expert knowledge map. Boldt (2001) found that
the knowledge map of the Master’s students had more well-defined concepts than
did the knowledge map of the introductory financial accounting students. The
results of this study informed the course instructors to revise their lesson plans for
the next courses. Again, however, individual students, well-defined, misdefined,
overdefined and underdefined concepts were not diagnosed.
    Kivlighan & Tibbits (2012) went one step further, identifying differences be-
tween each counseling trainee’s knowledge structure and an expert knowledge
structure in order to investigate trainees’ misconceptions with respect to coun-
seling. Four experienced group therapists and fifty group counseling trainees were
asked to use group counseling interventions for addressing a variety of group coun-
seling situations adapted from the Group Therapy Questionnaire. Data obtained
from the interventions were converted to knowledge maps via Pathfinder software.
First, each trainee’s knowledge map was compared to the expert counselors’ knowl-
edge map, and C index was computed which was ranged from .04 to .31 (M = .15,
SD = .06). Then, the discrepancies between the trainees’ knowledge structures

and the expert knowledge structure were classified into two categories, as errors
of omission or errors of commission. The link is called an error of commission
if two interventions are linked in trainees’ knowledge structures, but not in the
expert’s knowledge structure. On the other hand, the link is identified as an error
of omission provided that the link between two interventions is only present in the
expert’s knowledge structure. More than 75% of trainees had nine repeated errors
of omission, and only one frequently appearing error of commission (silence to
attack). As a result of cluster analysis, four distinct subgroups within the group
of trainees were identified. This finding might help trainers better focus their
instructional activities to trainees’ misconceptions.
    These studies show that Pathfinder software can be used for identifying stu-
dents’ incomplete understandings in four steps. First of all, a set of concepts to
be assessed must be identified. Then, an expert structure should be generated
based on several experts’ ratings. The next step is to obtain students’ structures.
Finally, each student’s knowledge structure is compared with the expert knowl-
edge map to find differences between the two knowledge structures. Although
Pathfinder software identifies students’ incomplete understandings, it fails to help
students to act on their partial understandings because of several limitations. For
example, Cooke (1992a) reveals that Pathfinder software does not allow users to
label links. In addition, even though the expert and student structures share the
same linked concept pairs, it does not mean that a student’s understanding is at
the expert level. Dicerbo (2007) also indicates this limitation and calls it a tradeoff
of the software that provides quantitative results to teachers about their students’
knowledge. Thus, identifying students’ misconceptions via Pathfinder software is
possible, but is not done automatically by the software.
    In another study, after each student’s misconceptions were identified, Trum-
power & Sarwar (2010) gave specific feedback and/or instructions to help students
gain a better understanding of any missing concept relations. Students were first
shown both their knowledge structure and an expert knowledge structure, and
then asked to reflect on similarities and differences. Additionally, students were
required to either solve problems or review examples which are aimed to reduce
the number of missing concept relations in their particular knowledge maps. Al-
though effective, the process was time and labor intensive due to the fact that each
student’s knowledge structure was manually evaluated by the researchers in order
to determine the individualized remedial activities (i.e., problems to solve and ex-
amples to review) corresponding with that student’s missing links and misconcep-
tions. Therefore, the time gap between identifying misconceptions and providing
remedial activities may have attenuated the effectiveness of the given feedback.
    To overcome these constraints, software programmers have developed some
applications based on the Pathfinder network generation algorithm. One such
application is our Concept Maps for Learning Website (CMFL). Within the CMFL
website, students create knowledge maps on a particular subject and then receive
individualized feedback and associated instructional material (e.g., videos, website
links, examples, problems, etc.) based on a comparison of their knowledge map
and a subject matter expert’s map. After studying the feedback and instructional

material, teachers can track their students’ progress by having them create revised
knowledge maps.
    There are four different user identities on the website: administrator, experts,
teachers and students. The role of the administrator is to gather sets of concepts
on a variety of topics and to create a list of experienced experts on each particular
topic. Then, experts are asked to rate the relatedness degree of concept pairs for
their topic of expertise. Next, the administrator creates expert knowledge maps
based on the mean expert ratings. Thereafter, the expert knowledge maps become
available for teachers and they can choose from amongst the topics. Afterwards,
students are provided with the concepts corresponding to the chosen topic and rate
the degree of relatedness between the concepts in order to generate their knowledge
map. The website then compares each student’s knowledge map with the expert
knowledge map to generate individualized feedback for each student. Feedback
is comprised of a visual presentation of the expert knowledge map superimposed
over the student’s map with any discrepancies highlighted by different types of
links. After reviewing this feedback, students are asked to reflect on each missing
link. That is, they are asked to think of ways in which the concepts connected
by the missing links might be related. Next, students are asked to study textual
explanations and linked material to better understand any missing links. After
again reflecting on ways in which the concepts connected by missing links are
related, students are asked to perform the concept relatedness rating task for a
second time in order to generate a revised knowledge map. This new knowledge
map can then be compared to the expert knowledge map to see any improved
understanding, after which the formative cycle may be repeated as necessary.
    In previous studies, we have described how the CMFL tool conforms with es-
tablished principles of assessment for learning, how it could be used in statistics
education, how it contributes to assessment for learning practices, and how it dif-
fers from other comprehensive digital knowledge map-based formative assessment
systems (Filiz, Trumpower & Atas 2012, Filiz, Trumpower & Atas 2013b, Filiz,
Trumpower & Atas 2013a, Trumpower, Filiz & Sarwar 2014).
    The personalized diagnosis and remedial learning system (PDRLS) (Chen 2011)
is another tool developed to capture students’ knowledge structure, identify stu-
dents’ misconceptions by comparing their knowledge structure with an expert
structure, and provide individual feedback relying on remedial learning paths much
like our own CMFL website. Chen (2011) conducted an experimental study to de-
termine the quality and effectiveness of PDRLS on improving students’ learning
performance. Students who were enrolled in a JAVA programming design course,
were randomly grouped into an experimental group (n = 72) and control group
(n = 73). After the assigned topic was taught, students created their knowl-
edge map via PDRLS and answered a pre-test consisting of 10 questions. Then,
students in the experimental group were asked to study remedial feedback for 30
minutes, whereas those in the control group only received their score based on their
knowledge structure. Finally, all participants took a ten-question multiple-choice
post-test. The results of this study indicated that learners in the experimental
group achieved more improved learning performance and self-efficacy than those
in the control group, and students with a lower level of knowledge received a

greater benefit from the PDRLS remedial feedback than those with a higher level
of knowledge.
    Although very similar, the PDRLS and our CMFL website have a few notable
differences. For example, students are shown their knowledge map and the expert
knowledge map on the same page in the PDRLS. In CMFL, however, students
receive individualized visual feedback which is comprised of a visual presentation of
the expert knowledge map superimposed over the student’s, with any discrepancies
highlighted by different types of links. Moreover, students receive instructional
materials through the diagnosed remedial learning path in the PDRLS. On the
other hand, in CMFL, instructional feedback is given on each missing concept
relation. Finally, all learners can access instructional content of the PDRLS, yet
only registered learners can interact with instructional materials in CMFL.
  In the following section, we will explore how students can interact with the
CMFL website on touch screen devices for the purpose of formative assessment.



3. How Concept Maps for Learning Website Works
   on Mobile Devices
    Initially, a panel of experienced statistics educators created a list of 6 concepts
related to ANOVA. The “experts” then rated the degree of relatedness of all pair-
wise combinations of these 6 concepts, after which the ratings were converted into
a knowledge map through the website (which uses the PFNET (∞, n−1)algorithm
to transform relatedness ratings into knowledge maps). The panel of experts then
created written explanations, and assembled various instructional materials, to il-
lustrate how any linked concepts in the expert knowledge map are related. These
explanations and materials were then uploaded into the website and linked to the
expert knowledge map. The resultant expert knowledge map is shown in Figure
6.

                      Degree of freedom                                            Number of groups




                   Sum of squares between groups                           Between-groups mean square




                                               Within-groups mean square


                  Figure 6: An example of expert knowledge map.

    At this point, students are ready to use the website to assess their conceptual
understanding of ANOVA and receive feedback and remedial instruction. First,
students are asked to rate the relatedness degree of concept pairs. Next, they
receive visual feedback in the form of their knowledge map superimposed over the
expert knowledge map (see Figure 7). A black line appears provided that there
is a link between two concepts in both an expert’s map and the student map
(ex. Between Group Means Square and Fixed Factors). This type of link will be
referred to as a relevant link. A grey dotted line appears if there is a link between
two concepts in the student map, but not in the expert’s map (ex. Between Group
Means Square and Deviation of Means from Group Means). This is referred to as
an extraneous link. Finally, a red dashed line appears (ex. Between Group Means
Square and Random Factors) if there is a link between two concepts in the expert
knowledge map, but there is no link between these concepts in the student map.
Such links are referred to as missing links.



                                                        F-ratio




                      Degree of freedom                                              Number of groups




                   Sum of squares between groups                           Between-groups mean square




                                               Within-groups mean square


                   Figure 7: An example of visual feedback map.



    In addition to this visual feedback, students are given additional instructional
materials which are linked to any missing links. First, when students tap on a
missing link, a text message appears which explains how the associated concepts
are related (see Figure 8); these explanations have been provided by subject matter
experts, but can be modified by individual teachers using the website.

    Second, if students hold down the mouse/their finger on a missing link, they
are able to access linked instructional material intended to illustrate the ways
in which the associated concepts are related (e.g., videos, website links, examples,
problems, etc.). Again, this material has been provided by subject matter experts,
but additional material can be added by individual teachers. As seen in Figure
9, the short explanation is also provided regarding how students should interact
with given linked feedback.

4. Conclusion
    The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the Pathfinder Scaling Algo-
rithm converts pairwise ratings into a knowledge map and to present how this
algorithm has been used to develop the CMFL website based on the principles of
effective formative assessment. In this regard, the Pathfinder structural assess-
ment technique was explained. The fundamental principle of this technique is to
compare students’ knowledge maps with an expert knowledge map. As a result of
this comparison, Pathfinder software computes three different measures showing
how students’ knowledge map and the referent expert knowledge map compare to
each other. However, specific remedial feedback is not given to students by the
Pathfinder software. Consequently, software developers have been developing a
few digital knowledge mapping tools (e.g., PDRLS and the CMFL website) which
use the Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm as a knowledge election technique, but add
in an individualized feedback and remediation component.
   In the future, we are planning to create more expert knowledge maps on a wider
range of subjects (e.g., history, physics and chemistry) to examine the usefulness
and effectiveness of the CMFL website across these subjects.
