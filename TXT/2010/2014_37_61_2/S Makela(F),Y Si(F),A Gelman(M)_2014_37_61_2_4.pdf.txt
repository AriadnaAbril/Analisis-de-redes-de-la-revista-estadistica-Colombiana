Abstract
Survey weights are used for correcting known differences between the sample and the population due to sampling design, nonresponse, undercoverage, and other factors. However, practical considerations often result in weights that are not constructed in a systematic fashion. Graphical methods can be useful in understanding complex survey weights and their relations with other variables in the dataset, particularly when little to no information on the construction of the weights is available. Graphical tools can also assist in diagnostics, including detection of outliers and extreme weights. We apply our methods to the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, an ongoing longitudinal survey.

Resumen
Los pesos de muestreo se utilizan para corregir las diferencias conocidas entre la muestra y la población debido al diseño muestral, la falta de respuesta, subcobertura, y otros factores. Sin embargo, consideraciones prácticas a menudo resultan en pesos que no se han construido de una manera sistemática. Los métodos gráficos pueden ser útiles en la comprensión de ponderaciones complejas de la encuesta y sus relaciones con otras variables del conjunto de datos, sobre todo cuando se dispone de poca información sobre la construcción de los pesos. Las herramientas gráficas también pueden ayudar en el diagnóstico, incluyendo la detección de valores atípicos y pesos extremos. Aplicamos nuestros métodos en el estudio de Familias Frágiles y Bienestar Infantil, un estudio longitudinal en curso.

1. Introduction
    Sample survey data typically differ systematically from their target popula-
tions. The differences arise from sampling design, unbalanced coverage of certain
subpopulations, and nonresponse. The standard approach to correct for the sam-
ple non-representativeness is weighting. Weights are typically constructed based
on some combination of adjustment factors based on inverse selection probability
(Horvitz & Thompson 1952), inverse response propensity (David, Little, Samuhel
& Triest 1983), and poststratification ratios (Holt & Smith 1979) of the census
distribution to the sample distribution. Hence an item’s weight depends on the
variables that affect its probability of inclusion in the survey. The design vari-
ables include, for example, the number of telephones in the household (in a phone
survey) and cluster size (in a probability-proportional-to-size design). The vari-
ables that affect the response propensity may include the individual’s demographic
and auxiliary information on previous waves, such as attrition rates, in a panel
or longitudinal study. When it comes to poststratification, the key variables on
demographics and design, such as income in a poverty measure survey that over-
samples in poor neighborhoods, need to be examined and used to account for the
discrepancy with the target population.
    In classical sampling theory, weights are used to generate design-consistent
estimators. Assume wi is the weight assigned to each unit i in the sample and yi
is one survey response variable of interest. The classical weighted ratio estimator
(Horvitz & Thompson 1952, Hájek 1971) for the population mean is
                                                         ,
                                             X               X
                                design
                           θ̂            =       wi yi           wi .                   (1)
                                             i               i


    Adjustment for inverse response propensity is often done using the response
propensity method, which applies the theory of propensity scores developed by
Rosenbaum & Rubin (1983) for causal inference to survey nonresponse (David
et al. 1983). Raking (Deming & Stephan 1940) is often used to match the weighted
sampling distribution in a survey to the external population distribution, partic-
ularly when the joint population distribution across poststratification cells is un-
known and only marginal distributions are available. Many recent developments
in weighting methods and applications are discussed in Levy & Lemeshow (2013)
and Lehtonen & Pahkinen (2004). Gelman (2007) and the associated discussions
point out the problems of weights in practice.
    In model-based approaches for sampling inference, the proper model speci-
fication of survey outcome should be conditional on the inclusion probabilities
(Rubin 1983). It has been shown in various settings that taking account of the
sample design in estimation will yield more efficient robust inferences (Zheng &
Little 2003, Si, Pillai & Gelman 2014). If the weights are informative for the survey
outcome, then ignoring the design information may result in biased conclusions.
Moreover, model fitting and evaluation play important roles since survey estimates
are sensitive to model misspecification.

    Therefore, to understand what weighting is doing in any particular example,
it can be useful to investigate the dependence between weights and the variables
affecting inclusion into the sample, as well as the joint distribution of the weights
and the survey responses of interest. In this article, we consider some graphi-
cal explorations of these relationships. When a few weights are extremely large
(corresponding to a few units in the sample that represent a large share of the
population), the weighted estimator will be highly noisy. Graphics can help reveal
extreme cases and suggest potential adjustments to improve precision. We are also
interested in studying the weights’ distributions for different waves in a longitu-
dinal study, where the baseline weight serves as the anchor for all the follow-up
weights. We demonstrate this visualization for a survey on which we are currently
working.


2. Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study
    The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a longitudinal survey of
children born in large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000, many of whom were
born to unmarried parents (Reichman, Teitler, Garfinkel & McLanahan 2001).
The term “fragile families” refers to new unwed parents with their children and
“the vulnerability of relationships within these families”. The study provides data
to help researchers understand the relationships in fragile families, particularly the
role of the biological father, as well as the impacts on these relationships of public
policies, especially those relating to welfare, paternity establishment, and child
support. We briefly summarize the sampling scheme and construction of weights
for the Fragile Families study; detailed descriptions can be found in Reichman
et al. (2001) and Carlson (2008), respectively.
    The sampling units for the Fragile Families study (Reichman et al. 2001) are
live births between 1998 and 2000 in large U.S. cities. The sampling frame is
multistage, sampling first cities, then hospitals, and finally births. The national
sample consists of 16 cities selected from nine strata designed to generate a sample
of cities varying widely in their public policies, such as welfare generosity and child
support enforcement, that directly affect many fragile families. Hospitals within
selected cities were sampled so as to ensure adequate coverage of non-marital births
in the city, and within selected hospitals, all non-marital and marital births were
selected until their respective quotas were achieved.
    The weighting construction for the Fragile Families study (Carlson 2008) ad-
justs for three things: unequal probability of selection across the multistage sam-
pling frame, nonresponse, and poststratification. Although the sampling unit is a
birth, the weights are constructed at the mother level. One set of weights is gener-
ated for analysis at the city level and another for analysis at the national level. For
the purposes of this paper, we use the national weights for the 16 sampled cities
that allow analyses of births in the sample to be generalized to births in large U.S.
cities. The weights are raked so that the weighted counts of births by mother’s
age, education, race/ethnicity, and marital status match known external counts:
city counts for the city weights and national count for the national weights. This

process can approximate the adjustment when the joint cross-tabulation of these
variables is available. The weights are also trimmed at an upper bound set as
the mean weight plus four standard deviations to avoid extremely large values.
To date, the study has collected five waves of data, and the weights include the
baseline weights and four sets of follow-up weights.


3. Graphical Illustration
    In this section, we investigate the contributions and patterns of survey weights
via statistical graphics. We consider several variables that are used in constructing
the weights, several outcome variables of substantive interest, and the five sets of
mother weights at the national level across the five waves in the Fragile Families
study.


3.1. Plotting Weights vs. Raking Variables
   The baseline national weights for mothers of the children in the sample are a
product of inverse inclusion probabilities accounting for the sampling design, and
nonresponse/poststratification factors accounting for unbalanced coverage. The
poststratification variables include mother’s age, race/ethnicity, education, and
marital status. Only marginal distributions of these variables were available at
the national level, and the adjustment was done by raking. We label these four
variables as raking variables, and plot them vs. the survey weights.
    Because the raking variables are categorical, simply plotting them against the
weights would not yield easily interpretable or informative plots. Therefore, we
divide the weights (on the logarithmic scale) into evenly-spaced bins. Within each
bin, we calculate the proportion of respondents at each level of the given variable.
We also include lowess fits to show overall trends and increase the readability of
the plots, particularly for the categorical variables with more than two levels.
   Intuitively, the weight values represent how many units each individual will
represent in the population. The weights inside each bin have close values, but
the correspondingly allocated sample sizes vary widely. The larger the weights,
the more likely that the individuals with some characteristic are undercovered in
the sample.
    Figure 1 shows plots of the four raking variables and the log weights. In Figure
1(a), we plot the binned weights against the proportion of mothers within each
bin who are married to the father of their baby. Marital status is strongly related
to the survey weights, with higher weights corresponding to higher proportions of
mothers who are married. For mothers whose weights fall into the smallest bins,
the proportion who are married is low; in fact, none of the mothers whose weights
are in the two smallest bins are married. On the other hand, nearly all of the
mothers whose weights are in the largest bins are married. This result agrees with
our expectation since the Fragile Families study oversampled non-marital births.

Figure 1: For four discrete raking variables in the Fragile Families study, we plot the
          proportion of respondents at each level of the given variable vs. binned
          baseline survey weights (log scale). The binned averages are smoothed by
          lowess curves. Sample size is high so we use a large number of bins (as
          indicated by the tick marks on the x-axes). A few of the tick marks are
          labeled to indicate the log weights in some of the bins; the total range of the
          weights is large, varying by a factor of approximately exp(8.5) or 5,000.
                                HS = high school.


    We can see in Figure 1(b) that larger weight bins contain higher proportions
of women with the least education (less than 8th grade) and most education (col-
lege or more) compared to smaller weight bins. In contrast, the proportion of
women with a high school diploma is relatively constant across weight bins. In
Figure 1(c), we plot the binned weights against the proportion of mothers within
each bin who are Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, white non-Hispanic, and other.
The racial/ethnic composition of mothers varies strongly across weight bins, with
higher proportions of black non-Hispanic mothers in smaller weight bins and larger
proportions of white non-Hispanic mothers in larger weight bins.
   Figure 1(d) shows the relationship between maternal age and binned weights.

weight bins but diverge for large weight bins. The age composition of mothers in
the largest weight bins is older, with most women aged 25-29 or 30-34 years and
smaller proportions of mothers aged 19 and under than in smaller weight bins.
    Figure 2 shows the sample size within each weight bin for the baseline survey
when the weights are binned on the original scale for all weight bins (Figure 2(a))
and for weight bins with sample sizes of less than 100 (Figure 2(b)). The sample
sizes are roughly proportional to the inverse of the weights. There exist some
extremely large weight values, and the corresponding sample sizes are extremely
small. This warns us that the weighted estimator may be highly variable. The
largest weights have already been trimmed: as explained in Carlson (2008), any
weights exceeding the cutoff of four standard deviations away from the mean weight
were set to this cutoff. Thus the largest weights observed in Figure 2 are smaller
than the largest weights generated by the weight construction process.

3.2. Plotting Weights vs. Response Variables

    To understand the relationship between the survey weights and the collected
response or outcome variables of substantive interest, we again generate binned
plots similar to those in Figure 1. In Figure 3, we bin the log weights and within
each bin, calculate the proportion of respondents at each level of mother-reported
health status for herself and the focal child. Similarly, in Figure 4, we bin the log
weights and within each bin, calculate the proportion of respondents whose focal
child is overweight or has asthma, the proportion of respondents who have received
welfare benefits, and respondents’ average annual household income. Whether the
child is overweight is asked only in the nine-year follow-up wave, while asthma and
health status are asked only in the one-year follow-up wave. Data on household
income and whether the mother has received welfare benefits are available for every
wave, but here we show them only for the one-year wave.


                                                                 Revista Colombiana de Estadística 37 (2014) 285–295

Statistical Graphics for Survey Weights                                                                                                                           291

    There is little statistical dependence between the weights and health-related
variables, as can be seen in Figures 3, 4(a), and 4(b). This indicates that weighting
should do little to change the distribution of health status within weight bins. In-
deed, when we calculate the overall proportion of overweight children in the Fragile
Families study, the unweighted proportion is 16.6%, while the weighted proportion
is 16.4%. Similarly, the unweighted and weighted proportions of mothers reporting
that their child’s health is excellent are 65.5% and 65.3%, respectively.
    However, the proportion of families who received welfare has a stronger rela-
tionship with the weights, with those at the extremes of the weight range being the
least likely to receive welfare. Similarly, except for the high incomes in the smallest
weight bins, larger weights are associated with higher incomes. In general, if the
weights are informative for the survey outcome variables, they should be included
in the analysis.

3.3. Weights Across Waves
    In the Fragile Families study, because there is no subsampling at the various
follow-up waves, constructing the follow-up weights consists mostly of nonresponse
adjustments and re-raking the weights so that the weighted totals of births in sub-
sequent waves add up to the baseline totals (Carlson 2008). Comparing summary
statistics between the follow-up weights and the baseline weights can help detect
extreme values or changes in the weights over time. Table 1 displays summary
statistics for the weights at baseline and subsequent waves. The weights are sub-
ject to high variability. The sample size decreases, and the weights become larger
in magnitude over time. This shift is reflected in the systematic increases in the
mean, median, and 25% and 75% percent quantiles in Table 1. Figure 5 displays
the density of the log weights, a plot that does not seem particularly revealing here

but could be valuable in other settings where a user is comparing the distribution
of weights from two or more different surveys. The one thing we do see here, in
both Table 1 and Figure 5, is that the weights from Year 9 show relatively large
shifts compared to those in the previous waves.

   It might also be useful to track the changes in individual weights via scat-
terplots or a parallel coordinate plot. Further information could be obtained by
constructing separate scatterplots or parallel coordinate plots for subsets of the
population.

4. Discussion and Conclusion

    This work is illustrative and preliminary rather than conclusive, but we feel it
is valuable in illustrating the possibility of graphical methods for studying survey
weights and their relationship with other survey variables. This provides an intu-
itive exploration on how the externally-supplied weights are constructed, the effects
of incorporating weights into analyses, and how to select an appropriate model.
Weight trimming and smoothing are often applied arbitrarily. The relationship
between weights and the design or raking variable will help find which variable
significantly increases the variability and needs collapsing or pooling in its own
distribution. When weights are informative for the response variables of interest,
we should take them into account. Weighting adjustment in longitudinal surveys
suffers from many practical issues, for example, how to build a robust model for
response propensity score prediction. We recommend the use of data visualization
in survey inference in concert with more complex analytical and computational
approaches.
