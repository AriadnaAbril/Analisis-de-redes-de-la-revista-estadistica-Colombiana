Abstract
We consider an arbitrary continuous cumulative distribution function F (x) with a probability density function f (x) = dF (x)/dx and hazard function hf (x) = f (x)/[1 − F (x)]. We propose a new family of distributions, the so-called proportional hazard distribution-function, whose hazard function is proportional to hf (x). The new model can fit data with high asymmetry or kurtosis outside the range covered by the normal, t-student and logistic distributions, among others. We estimate the parameters by maximum likelihood, profile likelihood and the elemental percentile method. The observed and expected information matrices are determined and likelihood tests for some hypotheses of interest are also considered in the proportional hazard normal distribution. We show an application to real data, which illustrates the adequacy of the proposed model.

Resumen
Consideramos una función de distribución continua arbitraria F (x) con función de densidad de probabilidad f (x) = dF (x)/dx y función de riesgo hf (x) = f (x)/[1 − F (x)]. En este artículo proponemos una nueva familia de distribuciones cuya función de riesgo es proporcional a la función de riesgo hf (x). El modelo propuesto puede ajustar datos con alta asimetría o curtosis fuera del rango de cobertura permitido por la distribución normal, t-Student, logística, entre otras. Estimamos los parámetros del modelo usando máxima verosimilitud, verosimilitud perfilada y el método elemental de percentiles. Calculamos las matrices de información esperada y observada. Consideramos test de verosimilitudes para algunas hipótesis de interés en el modelo con función de riesgo proporcional a la distribución normal. Presentamos una aplicación con datos reales que ilustra que el modelo propuesto es adecuado.
Palabras clave: asimetría, curtosis, distribución skew-normal, función de riesgo, método de los momentos, modelo de riesgo proporcional, verosimilitud perfilada.



1. Introduction
    When data originates from heavy-tailed or asymmetrical distributions, the
normality-based inferential processes are inadequate. In these situations many au-
thors choose to transform the variables in order to attain symmetry or normality.
These transformations produce unsatisfactory results because the interpretation of
the results becomes cumbersome. Although the class of elliptic distributions is a
good alternative for situations with heavy-tailed behavior, this is not appropriate
when the distribution is asymmetric. These circumstances prompted the search
for new distributions, better suited to fit data with high asymmetry or kurtosis.
The literature on families of flexible distributions has experienced great increase
in the last three or four decades. Some early results include Lehmann (1953),
Roberts (1966) and O’Hagan & Leonard (1976), among others. Azzalini (1985),
Durrans (1992), Fernandez & Steel (1998), Mudholkar & Hutson (2000), Gupta,
Chang & Huang (2002), Arellano-Valle, Gómez & Quintana (2004, 2005), Gómez,
Venegas & Bolfarine (2007), Arnold, Gómez & Salinas (2009), Pewsey, Gómez &
Bolfarine (2012) represent some of the important contributions.
   Azzalini (1985) defines a probability density function of a random variable Z
with skew-normal distribution and parameter λ, given by

                          fSN (z; λ) = 2φ(z)Φ(λz), z ∈ R                             (1)

where φ and Φ denote the standard normal density and the cumulative distribu-
tion functions, respectively. The skewness is controlled by the parameter λ. We
denote this by Z ∼ SN (λ). The asymmetry and kurtosis coefficients for this dis-
tribution are in the intervals (−0.9953, 0.9953) and [3, 3.8692), respectively. The
skew-normal distribution was first introduced by O’Hagan & Leonard (1976) as
a prior distribution for estimating a normal location parameter. The density (1)
has also been studied widely by Henze (1986), Chiogna (1998), Pewsey (2000) and
Gómez et al. (2007).
    Durrans (1992), in a hydrological context, introduced the fractional order
statistics distribution with density function given by

                   gF (z; α) = αf (z){F (z)}α−1 , z ∈ R, α ∈ R+                      (2)

where F is an absolutely continuous distribution function, f is a corresponding
density function and α is a shape parameter that controls the amount of asymmetry
in the distribution. We refer to this model as the power distribution. We use the
notation Z ∼ AP (α).
    Following the idea of Durrans, Gupta & Gupta (2008) we define the power-
normal distribution whose distribution function is given by
                           gΦ (z; α) = αφ(z){Φ(z)}α−1 , z ∈ R, α ∈ R+                         (3)
We use the notation Z ∼ P N (α). Pewsey, Gómez and Bolfarine (2012) showed
that the expected information matrix is nonsingular for the neighborhood of α = 1,
contrary to the skew-normal distribution where the information matrix is singular
under the symmetry hypothesis (λ = 0). They also found that the asymmetry and
kurtosis coefficients for this distribution are in the intervals [−0.6115, 0.9007] and
[1.7170, 4.3556], respectively.
    Figure 1 shows how the parameters α and λ control the asymmetry and kurtosis
of the (1) and (3) models.

     In this paper we present a new family of distributions so-called proportional
hazard distribution-functions. The paper is presented as follows. In Section 2 we
define the proportional hazard distribution-function, study some of its properties
and discuss maximum likelihood estimation. The location-scale extension for pro-
portional hazard distribution-function is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we
define the location-scale proportional hazard normal model and different methods
for parameter estimation; we derive the information matrix and discuss likelihood
ratio tests for some hypotheses of interest. Further, the asymptotic distribution of
maximum likelihood estimators is obtained. The usefulness of the proposed model
is illustrated in an application to real data in Section 5. Finally, some concluding
remarks are found in Section 6.

2. Proportional Hazard Distribution-Function
   Let F (x) be a continuous cumulative distribution function with probability
density function f (x) and hazard function hf (x) = f (x)/(1 − F (x)). We will say
that Z has proportional hazard distribution-function associated with F and f and
parameter α > 0 if its probability density function is

                      ϕF (z; α) = αf (z){1 − F (z)}α−1 , z ∈ R                       (4)

where α is a positive real number and F is a continuous distribution function
with continuous density function f. We use the notation Z ∼ P HF (α). The
distribution function of the P HF model is given by

                           F(z) = 1 − {1 − F (z)}α , z ∈ R                           (5)

   We observe that the name “proportional hazard distribution-function” is ap-
propriate because its hazard function with respect to the density ϕF is

                                 hϕF (x, α) = αhf (x)

    The inversion method can be used to generate a P HF (α) distribution. Thus,
if U is a uniform random variable on (0, 1),

                              Z = F −1 (1 − (1 − u)1/α )

obeys a P HF (α) distribution, whose median, Z0.5 , can be found from the inverse
of F through                             1/α      
                                     −1  2    −1
                            Z0.5 = F
                                           21/α
where F −1 is the inverse of the distribution F . In general, the p-th percentile can
be computed by                                        
                            Zp = F −1 1 − (1 − p)1/α

     The distribution mode is the solution to the non-linear equation

                         [1 − F (z)] f 0 (z) − (α − 1)f 2 (z) = 0

where f 0 is the derivative of F .
     In the next section we present some particular cases of the P HF distribution.


2.1. Proportional Hazard Normal Distribution
   When F = Φ, the standard normal distribution function, we obtain the pro-
portional hazard normal distribution, which we denote by P HN (α). Its density
function is given by

                       ϕΦ (z; α) = αφ(z){1 − Φ(z)}α−1 , z ∈ R                        (6)

                                       Revista Colombiana de Estadística 36 (2013) 95–114

Properties and Inference for Proportional Hazard Models                                         99

    This model is also an alternative to accommodate data with asymmetry and
kurtosis that are outside the ranges allowed by the normal distribution. The P HN
is a special case of Eugene, Lee & Famoye (2002)’s beta-normal distribution. A
simple comparison makes clear that P HN (1) = SN (0) = P N (1) = N (0, 1).
   The survival function and the hazard function are given, respectively, by

                               S(t) = {1 − Φ(t)}α and hϕΦ (t) = αhφ (t)

    That is to say, the P HN model’s hazard function is directly proportional to
the normal model’s hazard function. It can then be said that the hazard function
is a non decreasing (and unimodal) function of T, but an increasing function of
parameter α. It can also be said that for α > 1, the P HN ’s model hazard is
greater than the normal’s model, while for α > 1 the opposite occurs.
    In Figure 2-(a) we can see the behavior of the P HN (α) density and Figure 2-
(b) shows the model’s hazard function for a few values of the parameter α.

sity function

for diferents values of the α.

2.5. Moments of the PHF
   The moment generating function for the P HF distribution is given by

   There is no closed form for the moments of a random variable Z with distri-
bution P HF (α); these are computed numerically.
   The r -th Z moment for the random variable Y ∼ P HF can be obtained with
the expression

                µr = α                                                                                (11)

                                                                          r
This expectation agrees with the expected value of the function F −1 (y) where
                                                                

Y is a random variable with a Beta distribution with parameters α and 1. The cen-
tral moments µ´r = E(Z − E(Z))r for r = 2, 3, 4 can be found from the expressions

µ´2 = µ2 − µ21 , µ´3 = µ3 − 3µ2 µ1 + 2µ31 and µ´4 = µ4 − 4µ3 µ1 + 6µ2 µ21 − 3µ41 . Conse-
quently,
√         the variance asymmetry and kurtosis coefficients are σ 2 = V ar(Z) = µ´2 ,
   β1 = µ´3 /[µ´2 ]3/2 and β2 = µ´4 /[µ´2 ]2 , respectively.
    For F = Φ, that is, the case of the P HN (α) distribution, the r -th Z moment
is given by

                          Z 1
                                 −1  r
                 µr = α          Φ (y) (1 − y)α−1 dy, r = 0, 1, 2, . . .                           (12)
                           0


     Thus,√for α values between 0.0005 and 9,000 the asymmetry and kurtosis coef-
ficients, β1 and β2 of the variable Z ∼ P HN (α) belong to the intervals (-1.1578,
0.9918) and (1.1513,4.3023), respectively. Therefore the P HN distribution clearly
fits data with less negative asymmetry and more platykurtic than the SN and
P N distributions do. It also fits distributions with a higher positive asymmetry
than P N and more leptokurtic than SN . It is evident that the P HN distribution
fits data with as much positive asymmetry as SN distribution does and as much
kurtosis as P N distribution does.



3. Location-Scale PHF
    Let Z ∼ P HF (α) with α ∈ R+ . The family of P HF distributions with
location-scale parameters is defined as the distribution of X = ξ + ηZ for ξ ∈ R
and η > 0. The corresponding density function is given by

where ξ is the location parameter and η is the scale parameter. We use the notation
P HF (ξ, η, α).



3.1. Estimation and Inference for the Location-Scale PHF

    We now deduce the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for the parame-
ters of the P HF (ξ, η, α) distribution and the respective observed and expected
information matrices.
   For n observations, x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )> from the P HF (ξ, η, α) distribution,
the log-likelihood function of θ = (ξ, η, α)0 , given x, is

where zi = xiη−ξ . Thus, under the assumption that the derivative of f exists, the
score function is given by:
                                n                n
                             1 X f 0 (zi ) α − 1 X f (zi )
              U (ξ)   = −                  +                   ,

              U (η)   = −      −      zi       +      zi           ,

    MLE estimators are the solutions to this system of equations usually solved by
iterative numerical methods. It is usual to use a software algorithm implemented
in R (R Development Core Team 2013).

         Iηα   = E(zw)/η = a11 /η, and Iαα = 1/α2

  In general, these expected values are computed

When α = 1, we have ϕ(x; ξ, η, 1) = η1 f x−ξ  η    , the location-scale f function
model, thus the matrix information is reduced to

              (c02 − d0 )/η 2        (c12 − c01 − d1 )/η 2
                                                                       

The properties of this matrix depend on the function f .


4. Location-Scale Proportional Hazard Normal
   A very special particular case of the P HF (ξ, η, α) model occurs when F = Φ,
the standard normal distribution function. In this case the probability density
function is

which we call location-scale proportional hazard normal. Note that when α = 1 we
are in the case of the location-scale normal distribution.
    In what follows we discuss estimation by moments, maximum likelihood, pro-
filed likelihood and elemental percentile method for the P HN (ξ, η, α) model and
show the respective observed and information matrices for a P HN random vari-
able.

    The mean (µ), variance (σ 2 ) and asymmetry coefficient ( β1 ) in the location-
scale case are:

used to estimate Φ1 (α) and Φ2 (α), leaving a simple 2×2 system of linear equations
to solve, whose solution gives the ξ and η estimators. The asymptotic distribution
of moment estimators is widely studied in Sen & Singer (1993) and Sen, Singer &
Pedroso de Lima (2010).


4.2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Location-Scale
     PHN
   For n observations, x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )> from the P HN (ξ, η, α) distribution,
the log-likelihood function of θ = (ξ, η, α)> given x is
                                         n
                                         X                             n

     `(θ; x) = n log(α) − n log(η) +           log(φ(zi )) + (α − 1)         log(1 − Φ(zi ))
                                         i=1                           i=1

where zi = xiη−ξ . Thus, the score function, defined as the derivative of the log-
likelihood function with respect to each of the parameters, is:
                                           n
                                        n X

                                 1X         α − 1 X φ(zi )
                       U (ξ) =         zi +

                              n 1 X 2 α−1X           φ(zi )
                  U (η) = −     +       zi +      zi
                              η   η i=1      η i=1 1 − Φ(zi )
Setting these expressions to zero, we get the corresponding score equations whose
numerical solution leads to the MLE estimators.

4.2.1. Observed information matrix for location-scale PHN

4.2.2. Expected Information Matrix for the Location-Scale PHN

      Considering akj = E{z k wj }, the expected information matrix entries are:

                              η                     η                   α2
   The expected values of the above variables are generally
                                                           calculated using nu-
merical integration. When α = 1, ϕ(x; ξ, η, 1) = η1 φ x−ξ

normal density function. Thus, the information matrix becomes

                                 1/η 2                         −a01 /η
                                                                      
                                                   0
                       I(θ) =    0               2/η 2        −a11 /η 
                                −a01 /η          −a11 /η         1

      Numerical integration shows that the determinant is

                                   1                        0.013687
                        |I(θ)| =      [2 − a211 − 2a201 ] =          6= 0
                                   η4                          η4

so in the case of a normal distribution the information matrix of the model is non-
singular. The upper left 2 × 2 submatrix is the normal distribution’s information
matrix for the normal distribution.
      For large n and under regularity conditions we have
                                         A
                                       θ̂ → N3 (θ, I(θ)−1 )

and the conclusion follows that θ̂ is consistent and asymptotically approaches the
normal distribution with I(θ)−1 as the covariance matrix, for large samples.


4.3. Profile Likelihood Estimation for the Location-Scale PHN
    Maximum likelihood estimators of the P HN (ξ, η, α) distribution parameters
usually display high levels of bias in the estimation of the shape parameter α when
the sample size is small. Other estimation techniques can be used that result in
a more consistent estimation of α. Among these are the profile likelihood and
the modified profile likelihood (see Barndorff-Nielsen 1983, Severini 1998). Thus,
calling τ = (ξ, η)> the vector of parameters of interest and φ = α the nuisance
parameter, the profile likelihood is

                                       Lp (τ ) = L(τ , φ̂τ )


                                             Revista Colombiana de Estadística 36 (2013) 95–114

where φ̂τ = α̂(ξ, η) = −n       i=1 log   1 − Φ     η         . Substituting α̂(ξ, η) in
the original likelihood we obtain the profile log-likelihood, defined as the logarithm
of the profile likelihood:

                                                        !                          #
                                  X                                  1

                                                                     2

                        2 i=1      i=1

where zi = (xi − ξ)/η.
    Consequently, the profiled maximum likelihood estimators for ξ and η, that is,
                                                                   ∂` (ξ,η)
ξˆp and η̂p , are the solutions to the nonlinear equations up (ξ) = p∂ξ     = 0 and
           ∂`p (ξ,η)
up (η) =      ∂η     = 0, which are obtained with iterative numerical methods.
    Since sometimes the estimation of parameters by maximum likelihood can be
inconsistent or inefficient, Barndorff-Nielsen (1983) proposes a modified profiled
likelihood. Severini (2000) presents an alternative that is easier to apply in certain
models like P HN (ξ, η, α). The profiled likelihood is not an actual likelihood,
because some of the likelihood properties are not verified. for instance, the score
function may have a nonzero mean and the observed information can have a bias.
Nevertheless this function has go some interesting properties that make it look
like an actual likelihood. For more examples, properties and uses of estimation by
modified or unmodified profiled likelihood see Farias, Moreno & Patriota (2009).


4.4. Estimation by the Elemental Percentile Method for the
     Location-Scale PHN
   The elemental percentile method can also be used in the estimation of the
P HN (ξ, η, α) parameters applying the theory developed in Castillo & Hadi (1995).
    Estimation of ξ and η when α is known. If the shape parameter α is known,
the elemental percentile method for two order statistics x(i) and x(j) , with i < j,
leads to the equations

                                                  x(j) − x(i)
           η̂(i, j) =                         1/α                      1/α 
                                      (n−j)+1                        (n−i)+1
                        Φ−1 1 −         n+1            −Φ −1    1−     n+1


   and
                                                                           1/α !
                 ˆ j) = x(j) − η̂(i, j)Φ−1                    (n − j) + 1
                 ξ(i,                                1−
                                                                 n+1

    Then, proceeding like in the previous case (for α), we select m samples of
two order statistics and estimate the parameters ξ and η and again using robust
statistics we finally get the estimators for these parameters.

    A second estimation method, in two steps, using percentiles is illustrated next.
It is motivated in the fact that the maximum likelihood method gives fairly good
estimations of the location and scale (ξ and η) parameters.
   Initially it is assumed that the location and scale parameters are known and
their actual values are the MLE estimators, and we estimate α like in the standard
case. Once the α estimator is known, the second step is to suppose that this is the
actual value of the parameter and then we estimate the ξ and η values under the
assumption that α is known. The standard errors for the parameter estimations
can be computed using resampling techniques such as Jackknife or Bootstrap (see
Efron (1982, 1979)). In both cases above we took pi = i/(n + 1), given that we
know E(F) = i/(n + 1).


4.5. Simulation Study
   To study the MLE estimator properties of the P HN (ξ, η, α) distribution, a
simulation was carried out for α = 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0. Without loss of generality
the location and scale parameters were set at ξ = 0 and η = 1.
   The sample sizes in the simulation were n = 50, 100, 200 and 500 with 2,000
replications in each case. The random variable X with distribution P HN (ξ, η, α)
was obtained with the algorithm

                              X = ξ + ηΦ−1 (1 − (1 − u)1/α ),

where u is a uniform random variable U (0, 1). In all cases, the bias and root mean
square errors of the MLE estimators were calculated.
    The results shown in Tables (1) and (2) demonstrate that when the sample size
increases, the bias and root mean square error decrease, that is, the estimators
are asymptotically consistent. Still, a high bias in the shape parameter α for
small sample sizes is evident. In conclusion, this estimation process would be
recommended for very large sample sizes. Using the profiled likelihood estimation
method for α we found biases 0.2511 and 0.7241 for values α = 0.75 and 1.5
respectively with a sample size 100.

    Tables (3) and (4) show the behavior of estimators by the elemental percentile
method for the P HN (ξ, η, α) model. As can been seen, these also are asymptoti-
cally consistent and their biases are less than the biases of the maximum likelihood
estimators for a small sample. However, the bias of the α estimator is still too
large. For small sample sizes, Jackknife or Bootstrap estimators can be applied to
correct the bias of the MLE estimators (see, Efron 1982, Efron & Tibshirani 1993).

   In this illustration we use a dataset related to 1,150 heights measured at 1
micron intervals along a roller drum (i.e. parallel to the roller’s axis). This was
part of an extensive study of the roller’s surface roughness. It is available for
download at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/jasadata/laslett.
                                                              summary statistics:
    The data set to illustrate the PHN model has the following√
mean x̄ = 3.535 and variance s2 = 0.422. Teh quantities b1 = −0.986 and
b2 = 4.855 correspond√ to sample asymmetry and kurtosis coefficients. According
to the asymmetry ( b1 ) and kurtosis (b2 ) values there is a strong evidence that
an asymmetric model may provide a better fit for these data. We see that the
skewness and kurtosis values are outside the range allowed by the SN and P N
models, and even though the kurtosis value is greater than the one found in this
paper for the P HN model, the latter may provide a better fit than the SN and
P N models.
    We proceed then to fit the models P N , SN and P HN to the data set. Maxi-
mum likelihood estimators for each model are presented in Table (5), with standard
errors in parenthesis, obtained by inverting the observed information matrix. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the normality assumption (p-value = 0); while the
equality hypothesis of the roller variables’ mean is not rejected (p-value= 0.1308),
which justifies the fitness of the P HN model.

   To implement model comparison between the models considered above, we use
the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), which penalizes the maximized likelihood
function by the excess of model parameters (AIC = −2`(·)b + 2k, where k is the
number of parameters in the model), see Akaike (1974).
   According to this criterion the model that best fits the data is the one with
the lowest AIC. By this criterion the P HN model gives the best fit to the roller
data set. Graphs for the fitted models are shown in Figure 6. Figure 7-(a) shows
the qqplot calculated with the roller’s variable percentiles and the percentile of the
P HN variable calculated with the estimates of the parameters, while Figure 7-(b)
shows the empirical cumulative distribution functions and the estimated P HN
model.

Substituting the estimated values, we obtain

                                     −2 log(Λ) = −2(1135.866 − 1066.994) = 137.744

which when compared with the 95% critical value of the χ21 = 3.84 indicate that
the null hypotheses is clearly rejected. The PHN model is a good alternative for
modelling data.
    According to the AIC criterion the P HN model fits the roller data better than
the Normal, SN and P N models. So the P HN model captures the asymmetry
and kurtosis that the other models fail to capture. A reason for this situation is
in the fact that the asymmetry and kurtosis of these particular data are outside
the range allowed in the SN and P N models.
     We also estimated the model parameters using the two-step percentile method,
obtaining: ξbp = 6.8219(0.0133), ηbp = 1.3574(0.0028) and α bp = 75.3801(1.0902)
(where the estimation errors, in parentheses, were calculated with the Jackknife
method). Figure 8-(a) shows the P HN densities from MLE estimation (solid line)
and elemental percentile estimation (dash-dot line); Figure 8-(b) shows the corre-
sponding cumulative density functions. Note that this method provides estimates
that give a fairly good fit to the P HN model in comparison with the one fitted
by maximum likelihood, but the graphs of cumulative distributions give a better
fit to the distribution function estimated by maximum likelihood.


6. Concluding Remarks
    We have defined a new family of distributions whose hazard function is propor-
tional to hazard function concerning to original distribution function. We discussed
several of its properties and provided and estimation of parameters via maximum
likelihood, profile likelihood and elemental percentile methods. This is supported

with an application to real data in which we show that the P HN model provides
consistently better fits than the SN and P N models. The outcome of this prac-
tical demonstration shows that the new family is very general, quite flexible and
widely applicable.
