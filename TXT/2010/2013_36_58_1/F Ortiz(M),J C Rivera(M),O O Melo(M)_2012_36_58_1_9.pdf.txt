Abstract
A methodology is proposed to jointly model treatments with quantitative levels measured throughout time by combining the response surface and growth curve techniques. The model parameters, which measure the effect throughout time of the factors related to the second-order response surface model, are estimated. These estimates are made through a suitable transformation that allows to express the model as a classic MANOVA model, so the traditional hypotheses are formulated and tested. In addition, the optimality conditions throughout time are established as a set of specific combination factors by the fitted model. As a final step, two applications are analyzed using our proposed model: the first was previously analyzed with growth curves in another paper, and the second involves two factors that are optimized over time.
Key words: Growth curves, Multiple optimization, Response surfaces, Second order models.
Resumen
En este artículo se propone una metodología para modelar conjuntamente tratamientos con niveles cuantitativos medidos en el tiempo, mediante la combinación de técnicas de superficies de respuesta con curvas de crecimiento. Se estiman los parámetros del modelo, los cuales miden el efecto en el tiempo de los factores relacionados con el modelo de superficie de respuesta de segundo orden. Estas estimaciones se realizan a través de una transformación que permite expresar el modelo como un modelo clásico de MANOVA; de esta manera, se expresan y juzgan las hipótesis tradicionales. Además, las condiciones de optimización a través del tiempo son establecidas para un conjunto de factores específicos por medio del modelo ajustado. Como paso final, se analizan dos aplicaciones utilizando el modelo propuesto: la primera fue analizada mediante curvas de crecimiento en otro artículo, y la segunda consiste en dos factores que son optimizados a lo largo del tiempo.
Palabras clave: curvas de crecimiento, optimización múltiple, superficies de respuesta, modelos de segundo orden.


1. Introduction
    Sometimes in experimentation, researchers interest focuses on analyzing data
over time to know the tendencies of an individual or groups of individuals. In
other cases, the goal is not only the trend but also to know what combination of
factors can optimize the process over time. This latter context is the starting point
for analysis of growth curves and response surface methodology (RSM). Response
surface and growth curves are statistical methods frequently used in the analysis
of experiments. The purpose of the first is to determine the optimum operating
conditions of a process, whereas the latter method is used to model the effect of
treatments throughout time.
    Two applications of the above hybrid model approach are analyzed in this pa-
per. The first is an experiment to analyze the effect of dietary ingestion of sodium
Zeolite A (SZA) on the growth and physiology of sixty horses reported by Frey,
Potter, Odom, Senor, Reagan, Weir, Elsslander, Webb, Morris, Smith Weigand
(1992). The horses were randomly assigned to four treatments: control and three
levels of dietary SZA (0.66%, 1.32% and 2%). In addition, plasma silicon concen-
tration was measured at the times: t = 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 hours after ingestion on eighty
four days into the diet. The second study is an experiment about the waste-water
treatment, in which is common adding inhibitory agents to reduce the negative
environmental impact generated by these substances discharged into the receiving
water bodies. In such cases, we study the biological oxygen demand (BOD) as
a water pollution measure. Montoya Gallego (2012) performed a central com-
posite rotatable design adding combinations of detergent (D) and animal fat (AF)
to the residual water. The BOD, biomass growth and substrate consumption at
t = 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours after of mixture were observed.
    In both experiments, we are interested in studying the optimum combination
of factors throughout time that optimizes our response variable. Therefore, in
these kinds studies, we want to observe if the growth curves can be represented
by a cubic, quadratic or linear polynomial in time, and if the response surface can
be expressed by a quadratic or linear polynomial in the treatments. Furthermore,
we want to obtain the confidence band(s) for the expected combination of factors
over time (response surface throughout growth curves).
   A growth curve is a model of the evolution of a quantity over time. Growth
curves are widely used in biology for quantities such as population size, body height
or biomass. Growth curve experiments have been considered from various angles

& Venables (1988), Kshirsagar Boyce (1995), Srivastava (2002), Pan Fang
(2002), Chiou, Müller, Wang Carey (2003) and Kahm, Hasenbrink, Lichtenberg-
Fraté, Ludwig Kschischo (2010). All of these growth curve studies involve
successive and correlated measurements on the same individuals which are divided
into two or more groups of treatments. We use in this paper treatments that are
combinations of quantitative factors which are based on polynomial models in the
response surface.
   RSM uses statistical models and therefore practitioners need to be aware that
even the best statistical model is an approximation to reality. In this way, if re-
searches are interested in modeling and analyzing situations to determine optimum
operating conditions for a process; this particular analysis is performed through
the RSM. It is widely applicable in the biological sciences, chemistry, social exper-
imentation agriculture, engineering, food sciences, quality control and economics,
among others. The RSM has been developed in experimental and industrial pro-
duction by Box Wilson (1951), Hill Hunter (1966), Mead Pike (1975),
Lucas (1976), Box Draper (1982), Draper Ying (1994), Chiou, Müller &
Wang (2004) and Box Draper (2007). These authors discussed some first-order
and second-order response surface designs from the point of view of their ability
to detect certain likely kinds of lack of fit for a higher’s degree polynomial than
has been fitted.
    The two previous approaches to growth curve and RSM problems are now
mixed to give a solution to our two applications because we need to know what is
the combination of factors over time that best works in the optimization process.
Our methodology is derived from the theory of multivariate normal analysis of
variance, and it is based on polynomial models for both growth curve and response
surface. Moreover, we provide both confidence bands and the over-all tests of
significance for various kinds of compound hypotheses that involve the parameters
of the proposed model. Furthermore, we find the optimal operating conditions
over time.
    This kind of problem was previously studied by Guerrero Melo (2008) pro-
viding a solution where they combined the response surface and the growth curve
techniques using an univariate analysis. In this paper, the same is done to obtain
the functional relationship that exists between the treatment and time in order
to predict its effect in any future time. Although, there are several phenomena of
this kind where these two techniques may be used simultaneously, a procedure that
combines them at the same time is not known using multivariate analysis. This
analysis works better than the univariate approximation presented by Guerrero &
Melo (2008) because the different statistics for hypothesis testing are exact, which
does not always happen in the univariate approach.
    The experiments to be considered are characterized by the presence of k fixed
quantitative factors, ζ1 , ζ2 , . . . , ζk , associated with a continuous variable of interest
Y , where the observed levels of each factor are equally spaced and the response
variable is measured on the same experimental units in several moments.

    The plan of the paper is the following: Section 2 presents the response surfaces
model in growth curves. Then in Section 3, parameter estimation, hypotheses
testing and test statistics are presented. Section 4 is dedicated to locating the
optimum; at first the model is reparametrized (Section 4.1), and then the optimal
point is found (Section 4.2). Finally, two applications of our procedure are showed
in Section 5, and the conclusions are exposed in Section 6.


2. Response Surfaces Model in Growth Curves
   The growth curve model implies that there are g different groups or treatments
and a single growth variable y, which is measured at q time points t1 , t2 , . . . , tq
on nj individuals chosen at random from the j-th group (j = 1, 2, . . . , g). A
polynomial regression of degree (p − 1) for y on the time variable t is defined.
Thus,

                        E(yt ) = φj0 t0 + φj1 t1 + · · · + φj(p−1) tp−1                         (1)

t = t1 , t2 , . . . , tq , q > p − 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , g. The observations yt1 , . . . , ytq on the
same individual are correlated, and come from a multivariate normal distribution
with unknown variance-covariance matrix Σ, equal for all the individuals. Let Y j
denote the nj × q matrix of the observations for the j-th group, and let

                                    Y0 = [Y 01 , Y 02 , . . . , Y 0g ]

denote the q × n matrix for all the n = n1 + n2 + · · · + ng individuals. Then from

more, the matrix Gp×q relates the parameters of the curve with the corresponding

where
                                             

                                           φg
is the g ×p matrix of the growth curve coefficients, and A = diag[Jn1 1 , Jn2 1 , . . . Jng 1 ]
is a block diagonal matrix of order n × g ‘group indicator’. Therefore, assuming
independence between individuals, we have that
                                V ar(V ec(Y)) = I n ⊗ Σq                                   (4)
where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product of two matrices (see Magnus (1988)).
   The equations (3) and (4) conform to the growth curve model introduced by
Potthoff Roy (1964), and later analyzed by Khatri (1966), Grizzle Allen
(1969), Kabe (1974), and Khatri (1988), among many others.


2.1. Construction of Proposed Model
    With the idea of making a joint modeling of growth curves and response sur-
faces, a couple of aspects were considered:

   1. The matrix An×g , whose columns contain information about treatments,
      was changed by a new matrix Xn×s , whose columns register the levels of
      a factor and their interactions for each of the n individuals, just like in
                          surfaces designs with k quantitative fixed factors and
      second order response
      s = 1 + k + (k + k2 ) parameters in the surface.
   2. For relating the parameters from the response surface with each of the
      groups, a new matrix of parameters θ s×g was included in the model where θlj
      measures the effect of the l-th parameter in the surface for the j − th group.
      Let Φg×p be the matrix that relates the groups with the growth curve co-
      efficients, i.e., φjm is the parameter associated to the degree coefficient m
      in the growth curve for the j-th group (l = 1, 2, . . . , s; j = 1, 2, . . . , g; m =
      0, 1, . . . , p − 1).

    Under the usual assumptions described above and maintaining the same struc-
ture and interpretation for the matrices Yn×q and Gp×q , the proposed model is
given by
                       E(Yn×q ) = Xn×s θ s×g Φg×p Gp×q                      (5)

   Notice that the model (5) is a classic model Potthoff Roy (1964) adaptation
in which the matrix ξ s×p = θ s×g Φg×p , whose components are given by
                                                           g
                                                           X
                                                   ξlm =         θlj φjm
                                                           j=1

which is the parameter associated with the l-th component of the surface in the
m-th growth curve degree (l = 1, 2, . . . , s and m = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1). This allows to
write (5) as
                         E(Yn×q ) = Xn×s ξ s×p Gp×q                                    (6)

      Another form for writing this model is
                           p−1 
                           X                       k

                                                                        k X
                                                                        X                              
               E(yia ) =               ξm

                                                                                                            a             (7)

or equivalently the model (6) can be written as
                p−1
               X                     k            p−1

                                                           rr 0 is the parameter that denotes
the effect of the interaction between the factors r and r0 in the m-th growth
curve degree (r, r0 = 1, 2, . . . , k and m = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1), xir and xir0 are encoded
explanatory variables associated to the factors r-th and r0 -th, respectively, and yia

    Note that the model (7) is in fact a growth curve whose coefficients are them-
selves a response surface of order two, and the model (8) is a response surface
whose parameters are growth curves. Moreover in (7), it is necessary to point out
                                                                                0

The remarks above are of great utility in section 3.2 for building the hypotheses
of interest on the model parameters.


3. Inference on the Model
3.1. Parameter Estimation
    Parameter estimation is achieved by expressing the model (6) as a MANOVA
classic model, using the following transformation

                                       Y4 = YP−1 G0 (GP−1 G0 )−1                                                          (9)

with P any symmetric positive definite matrix, such that (GP−1 G0 )−1 exists.

Response Surfaces Optimization in Growth Curves                                    159

   By applying the transformation (9) in (6), the next expression is obtained
                 4
              E(Yn×p ) = Xn×s ξ s×p                                               (10)
             V ar(Yi4 ) = (GP−1 G0 )−1 GP−1 ΣP−1 G0 (GP−1 G0 )−1
                        = Σ4
                           p ,         i = 1, 2, . . . , n

   Potthoff Roy (1964) found that taking P = Σ produces the minimum vari-
ance estimator for ξ; however, since Σ is unknown, in practice P is given by

                        P = S = Y0 {I − X(X0 X)−1 X0 }Y                           (11)

Note that P can take different forms which depend of the data correlation struc-
ture; a complete discussion about P can be found in Davis (2002), Molenberghs
& Verbeke (2005), and Davidian (2005).
    Then, for model (10), the parameter estimators obtained with the maximum
likelihood method are given by
                                                 4
                               ξ = (X0 X)−1 X0 Y

   From a slight extension of the result given by Rao (1967) in equation 50, we
can find that the unconditional covariance matrix of the elements of b ξ can be
expressed as              
                                                  −1
                    V ar bξ 0 = n−s−1 (X0 X) ⊗ Σ4
                                   n−s−q+p−1                               (13)

where ⊗ is the Kronocker product, and V ar(b ξ 0 ) denotes the covariance matrix of
the elements of ξ taken in a columnwise manner.
                 b
   It is easily shown that E(bξ) = ξ, and using a result given by Grizzle Allen
                                  −1
(1969), we find that E((GS−1 G0 ) ) = (n − s − q + p)Σ4 . From this last equation
                                                                            ξ is
and equation (13), it follows that an unbiased estimator of the variance of b
                            
                                                    −1
                      Vdar bξ 0 = n−s−q+p−1
                                     n−s−1
                                             (X0 X) ⊗ Σ  b4                    (14)

where
                        b4 =      1
                        Σ              (GS−1 G0 )−1
                               n−s−q+p

    In next Subsection, we will present a classic technique for testing a hypothesis
of the form C ξ U = 0 under the generalized expectation model (6), and also we
will obtain related confidence bounds.


3.2. Hypothesis of Interest and Test Statistics
   As shown in the section 2.1, the model (6) can be written by expressions (7)
and (8), where it can be observed that the hypotheses of interest lie mainly on the

rows or the columns of the matrix ξ. These and many other can be written in the
conventional general linear hypothesis form

                    H0 :    CξU = 0             vs          H1 :      C ξ U 6= 0                        (15)

where Cc×s and Up×u are known matrices of ranges c (≤ s) and u (≤ p), re-
spectively. The matrices that define the main hypotheses, together with their
corresponding interpretation, are shown in Table 1.

   For the construction of the test statistics, the following two matrices should be
kept in mind

                              H = U0 b                     ξU
                              E = U0 (GS−1 G0 )−1 U

where

      R1 = I + (X0 X)−1 X0 YS−1 I − G0 (GS−1 G0 )−1 GS−1 Y0 X (X0 X)−1
                                                      


    H and E play a decisive role in building the four classic multivariate test
statistics used in testing hypothesis (15) under the model (10): the Roy’s test uses
the largest characteristic root of (HE−1 ), the Lawley-Hotelling T 2 = tr(HE−1 ),
the trace of Bartlett-Nanda-Pillai V = tr(H(H + E)−1 ), and the statistic proposed

by Wilks (1932),    E   /   H + E    ∼ Λ(u,c,m) with m = n − [s + (q − p)], which is known
as the λ-criterion.
    The hypotheses in Table 1 involves one row vector or one column vector. There-
fore, we now state the general rule of rejecting a null hypothesis based on Wilks’s
Λ, using a level of significance α. To test the null hypothesis ξ (m) = 0, we use the
following test presented in Kshirsagar Boyce (1995)
                                           1 − Λ ddf
                                    u1 =
                                             Λ ndf
where ddf is the denominator degree of freedom and ndf is the numerator degrees
of freedom. Then, the null hypothesis ξ (m) = 0 is rejected if u1 > F(α,ndf,ddf ) .
   To test the null hypothesis ξ (l) = 0, we use the following test presented in
Kshirsagar Boyce (1995)
                                                  
                               1 − Λ c + ddf − u
                          c1 =
                                   Λ         u
Then, the null hypothesis ξ (l) = 0 is rejected if c1 > F(α,u,c+ddf −u) .
    On the other hand, simultaneous 100(1-α)% confidence bounds for the function
b0 CξUf , ∀ b(c×1) and f(u×1) , are given by
                               n                                       o1/2
                   b0 CξUf

                                    1−hα       (b0 CR1 C 0 b)(f 0 Ef )              (16)

where the prediction is, of course, the first term of the equation (16) and hα
stands for the α fractile of the distribution for the Roy’s largest characteristic root
statistic tabulated by Heck (1960) with its three parameters (denoted by s, m and
n in Heck’s notation, but here denoted, respectively, by s∗ , m∗ and n∗ ) equal to
s∗ = min(c, u), m∗ = (   c − u    − 1)/2 and n∗ = (n − s − (q − p) − u − 1)/2.
    Other test statistics are presented in some works; for instance, Grizzle and
Allen’s statistic (1969) which considers a variant for the matrix associated the
hypothesis (relating to the herein presented). Singer Andrade (1994) remarked
on the appropriate selection of error terms and presented a test statistic that
follows an exact F distribution (under H0 ). This was also used in the application
of Section 5, since it yielded the same decisions as the test statistics exposed there.


4. Location of the Optimum
   The crucial goal of the response surface methodology is to find the optimal
operating conditions for the variable of interest, and in this scenario, their behavior
throughout time is added.


4.1. Reparameterization of the Model
   In order to find the optimal operating conditions in presence of multiple re-
sponses, it is convenient to find an expression that us allows to distinguish the


                                      Revista Colombiana de Estadística 36 (2013) 153–176

terms of order zero, one and two of the model (10). This model can be reparametrized
as
      b4 = b0
      Y          + (x01×k b k×p ) + (x0 B(0) x, x0 B(1) x, . . . , x0 B(p−1) x)
        i1×p 1×p
                                                                                       (17)
             = b 01×p + (x01×k b k×p ) + (x01×k Bk×kp )(Ip ⊗ xk×1 )

where xk×1 is the vector associated to the k factors of the response surfaces,
b 01×p is the vector whose components are the intercepts of each curve degree,
b k×p is the matrix that contains the coefficients associated to the k linear terms
of the response surface for each of the curve degrees, and Bk×kp is the matrix
(B(0) , B(1) , . . . , B(p−1) ) with B(m) (m = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1) being the k × k matrix
associated to the quadratic form of the response surface for the m-th growth curve
degree.


4.2. Optimization
   The location of the optimal point is obtained by solving the equation system
resulting from the expression

                 b4
                ∂Y                       .         .        .
                   i
                     = b k×p + 2[B(0) x .. B(1) x .. · · · .. B(p−1) x] = 0            (18)
                 ∂x
which is demonstrated using properties of differential matrix calculus.
   By applying the vec operator in system (18), the following system of k variables
and kp equations is obtained
                                           
                                    B(0) x
                                   (1) 
                                   B x 
                  vec(b k×p ) + 2          =0
                                           
                                       ..
                                  
                                       .   
                                            
                                     (p−1)
                                   B       x
                                                      1
                                              B0 x = − vec(b k×p ),
                                                      2
which is solved by appending to it a pre-matrix B; hence, the stationary point is
                                   1
                             x0 = − (BB0 )−1 Bvec(b k×p )                              (19)
                                   2
and the non-singularity of BB0 is guaranteed by the linear independence of the
columns of X0 X.
    Let γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γk be the characteristic roots of the matrix BB0 , then the nature
of the stationary point is determined by

   • If γv > 0 ∀v = 1, 2, . . . , k, then x0 is minimum.

   • If γv < 0 ∀v = 1, 2, . . . , k, then x0 is maximum.

   • In any other case, x0 is a saddle point.

    Using (16) with C = I, U = I, b0 = x0 and f = G(m) ; the confidence bounds
for the predicted values of the optimal point in each moment are given by

where G(m) is a column of the matrix G and n∗ = (n − s − 2)/2.


5. Applications
   Two applications are analyzed in this Section: the first is an experiment to
analyze the plasma silicon concentration and its effect over the dietary ingestion
of SZA on the growth of sixty horses (Frey et al. 1992), and the second is an
experiment about the waste-water treatment, where the biological oxygen demand
(BOD) as a water pollution is studied (Montoya Gallego 2012).


5.1. Plasma Silicon Concentration
    An experiment to analyze the effect of dietary ingestion of SZA on the growth
and physiology of sixty horses was reported by Frey et al. (1992). The horses were
randomly assigned to four treatments: control (0%) and three levels of dietary
SZA (0.66%, 1.32% and 2%). In addition, the plasma silicon concentration was
measured in the times: t = 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 hours after ingestion at eighty four days
into the diet. This data was previously analyzed by Kshirsagar Boyce (1995)
employing growth curves, but they did not consider the surface responses part.
However, Guerrero Melo (2008) presented an optimization process that combines
response surface and growth curves from a univariate approach. The last analysis
differs from the work in this paper because we make a parameter estimation which
does not depend on the transformation of equation (9). Additionally, the test
statistics used in Guerrero Melo (2008) follow a F distribution approximately,
while under the multivariate perspective employed throughout this paper, these
tests follow an exact distribution of Wilks’s Λ.
     Figure 1 shows profiles plot for these data. In this Figure, we see that the
silicon concentration in the plasma can be modeled as a cubic polynomial over
time. Also, the control group (0%) seems to have a different behavior than other

where the rows are growth curves for the different parameters of the response
surface, and the columns correspond to response surfaces for the different growth
curve degrees. So, the first row contains the intercepts of the surfaces for the
polynomial degrees, the second row contains the linear component of the factor
(SZA), and the third row contains the quadratic component of the factor.
    Now, the results of the hypotheses testing on the rows (surface parameters)
and the columns (curve coefficients) of ξ are shown in Table 2. The hypothesis
H0 : ξ (4) = 0 yields a p − value < 0.001; therefore, the hypothesis is rejected.
This means that the third-order coefficient of the fitted growth curve is significant
in the model (see right panel of Figure 2). The hypothesis H0 : ξ (3) = 0 also
yields a p − value < 0.001, denoting that the quadratic component of the factor
is important, too (see left panel of Figure 2). The hypothesis H0 : ξ (2) = 0 is
the only one that is not rejected, it corresponds to the linear component of the
curve. However, since the degree of the cubic growth curve is significant, the linear
component is also included due to the hierarchy of the fitted growth curve.

    Under the same reasoning used in equation (21), it is possible to construct
the growth curve for the optimum point (1.7%), which is given by 5.99 − 0.43t +
0.37t2 − 0.03t3 . Figure 2 (right panel) shows the optimum supremacy over all

    According to the results obtained in this application, we can stand out three
facts:

     one time (t = 1) was removed to get that the remaining times (t = 0, 3, 6, 9)

     were equally spaced; the quadratic component SZA factor in the response
     surface was not significant, and also a linear polynomial for the growth curve
     was fitted.

  2. the hypothesis H0 : ξ (3) = 0 is rejected, justifying the inclusion of the
     quadratic component in the response surface to fit the plasma silicon con-
     centration. Note that in our proposal the test statistic follows an exact F
     distribution.
  3. Figure 1 clearly suggests that we should fit a cubic model in the growth
     curve, which is corroborated by the results of the hypothesis H0 : ξ (4) = 0.


5.2. Environmental Pollution
    During waste-water treatment it is common inhibitory agents to reduce the
negative environmental impact generated by to add substances discharged into the
receiving water bodies. Montoya Gallego (2012) performed a central composite
rotatable design adding combinations of detergent (D in ppm) and animal fat
(AF in ppm). They studied the residual water BOD and biomass growth and
substrate consumption at t = 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 hours after the mixture. These
components interfere with the biological degradation of organic material during
the process of waste-water treatment. In this case, we study the biomass (in mg/l)
growth as a water pollution measure. According to Montoya Gallego (2012), the
presence of detergents and animal fat in the affluent waste-water affect the size and
shape of the resulting floccules, which produces as a result a decrease in biomass
concentration demanding more time for the system retention that translates into
a low BOD elimination.
    A description of the behavior of the four factorial points (treatments) of the
experimental design throughout time is shown in Figure 3 (left panel). This Fig-
ure shows a slight increase of biomass between 12 and 24 hours after that the
treatments were applied. Furthermore, we see an accelerated growth between 24
and 48 hours and a slight decrease from 48 until 60 hours. This behavior can be
approximated by a cubic polynomial throughout time. Moreover, it is noted that
the profiles for the four treatments have a very similar behavior, which suggests
that there is not a differential effect for factors D and AF.
    In order to observe the behavior of biomass growth at each time point, we
fitted the univariate response surfaces for each time (see Figure 4). We can see
that the fitted surfaces for the first two times (t = 12, 24) have a convex shape
unlike the three last times (t = 36, 48, 60), which have concave shape. The points
that optimize each response surface are shown in Table 6; there is a change in the
optimal location point between two convex curves and three concave curves.

   To fit the model (6), we first analyzed the structure of the matrix P given in
equation (9). Then, we evaluated several possible covariance structures considering
the fit to the data and comparing them in terms of Akaike information criterion
(AIC). So, it was found that the best covariance structure was an AR(1) with
parameter estimates: φb = 0.676 and σ b = 23.51, and the smallest AIC was 492.1.
Thus, the estimated parameters matrix using the equation (12) is

whose first row represents the estimates of the response surface intercepts (ξ m  0 )
in the four degrees of growth curve following the expression (7). The second and
third rows are associated with the linear effects of factors AF and D, while the
third and the fourth rows are associated with the quadratic effects of the factors,
and finally; the sixth row estimates the interaction of two factors in all degrees of
the growth curve.
    Once the above is done, we show in Table 7 the results of the hypotheses
testing on the rows (surface parameters) and the columns (curve parameters) of ξ.
According to the hypothesis ξ (4) = 0, a cubic polynomial fit to the growth curve
is suitable (p − value = 0.0039), while for the hypothesis ξ (2) = 0, . . . , ξ (6) = 0,
we do not find evidence of a significant difference between the effects generated by
AF and D factors in the experimental design. This is consistent with the behavior
seen in Figure 3 (left panel) for the four treatments of central composite rotatable
design; however, these factors could be interacting with the time (see Figure 3,
left panel) so these components will be kept in the model.

   From the matrix for the estimated parameters the estimated growth curves for
the four treatments are constructed. For example, for the treatment AF=140 and
D=120, the growth curve is given by the equation

   For the four treatments, the estimated growth curves are summarized in Table
8 and Figures 5 and 3 (right panel). Figure 5 compares the estimated curve fitting
with the observed profiles where we see that the fitted growth curves provide a
good fitting for the data.

    In the same way, we can find estimates for the response surfaces at each point
                                                         ξG and are summarized
in time; these equations are derived from product matrix b
in Table 9 and in Figure 6. This Figure shows contour plots constructed for the
biomass growth at each point in time.

   It is stressed that the fitted surfaces in the times t = 12, 24, 48, 60 capture the
behavior concave or convex observed in univariate surface plots (see Figure 4).
Moreover, we can conclude from the contour plots that a point located approxi-
mately at the coordinate (100, 60) optimizes the process regularly well through-
out time, minimizing the fitted surfaces at t = 12, 24 and maximizing them at
t = 48, 60.

where b is constructed using the linear effect estimations for the two factors (second
and third rows of the estimated parameters matrix, b   ξ). B(0) , B(1) , B(2) and B(3)
are conformed by the elements of the estimated parameters matrix and kept the
reparameterization structure used in the univariate response surface model i.e.
the diagonal terms are equivalent to the quadratic effects for each factor, and the
off-diagonal elements are equivalent to half of the estimated interaction effects.

   Thus, following the expression (19), the coordinates for the optimal point
that optimizes the process throughout time are found. These are AF= 96.6
and D= 55.3 which are within the observation region of the central composite
rotatable design and are in accordance with the behavior seen in the previous
contour plots. The confidence bounds for optimum constructed using (20) and
x0 = (1, 96.6, 55.3, 96.62 , 55.32 , 96.6(55.3)) are shown in Table 10.
   Under the same reasoning used in equation (22), it is possible to construct the
growth curve for the optimum found (AF= 96.6 and D= 55.3), which is given by

the optimization achieved throughout time, minimizing the growth of biomass for
times t = 12, 24 and maximizing relatively well for time t = 36, 48, 60 (see Figure

6. Conclusions
    A joint modelling procedure that gives additional information regarding the
interaction of the studied methodologies, as opposed to analyzing them indepen-
dently, was proposed. In this way, the functional relationship of the response
surface parameters with time was modeled by condensing the information of the
groups of the usual growth curves analysis. Also, parameter estimation, hypothe-
sis testing, test statistics and confidence bounds were obtained. Finally, under the
proposed model, the optimal point that optimizes the response variable regularly
well throughout time was found.
    In both applications, we studied the optimum combination of factors that opti-
mized our response variable throughout time. Therefore, we fitted a cubic growth
curve and a quadratic response surface for the treatments in both situations. In
plasma silicon concentration study, it was optimized at a level of dietary ingestion
of SZA 1.7% throughout time, so we can say that the plasma silicon concentration
has a good growth in horses using this level. In biomass growth, we found that the
optimum condition was in the combination of animal fat at a level 96.6 ppm and
detergent at a level 55.3 ppm; consequently, using this combination between animal
fat and detergent, we optimize this inhibitory behavior during aerobic treatment
of waste-water.
