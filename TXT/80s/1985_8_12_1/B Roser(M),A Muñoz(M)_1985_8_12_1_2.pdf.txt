THE USE OF PILOT STUDY DATA IN THE ESTIMATION OF SAMPLE SIZE

Sumary
In the two sample binomial case, one approach to the estimation of sample size is to conduct a pilot study and assume that the observed proportion in the pilot study have no sampling error and are in fact true population parameters which can be used directly in standard sample size formulas. This approach has conceptual difficulties when such a pilot study
is small since there is typically considerable error in the observed proportions. In this paper we propose an alternative method which takes into account the sampling error in pilot study data in the estimation of sample size for a larger study. Tables are provided comparing these two
methods and it is shown that the former deterministic method may provide a grossly inaccurate estimate of the appropriate sample size for a larger study, particularly for small pilot studies.

Introduction.

        It is sometimes the case in planning large
clinical studies to first conduct- a pilot study
for the purpose of (a) establishing the feasi-
bility of a large    study and    (b) estimating the
appropriate sample size for the large study in
case the study is feasible. The idea of using
pilot study data in the estimation of sample size
has been discussed generally in Armitage (1973,
p.l87) and Hill (1977, p.286).       In   this
paper, we focus more specifically on quantifying
how to use pilot study data where the purpose

                                                       11


of the large study is to compare proportions in
two independent samples.

      Specifically, we wish to test the hypothe-
sis H : p   = p , vs. H.-.p 4 p . . Suppose we have
     0*^0     "^1      l'^o'^l        ^^
obtained the sample proportions 0 = x /n .
^                                     " ^ o o o '
p. = X../n.. for the control and treatment group
respectively in the pilot study and wish to use
p , p. to estímate the sample size in the large
study.      A widely used estimator    (Snedecor and
Cochran (1980, p.l29)) for the appropriate sam-
              N.. = N for each group in the large
 le size N = N.,
pie
          o    1
 tudy is given by the formula


    ^ = ^W6^^^''o'ío+Pl'íl>/<Po-Pl>^               (1.1)

where q .   = l-p-, I   = 0,1 and z   is the lOOx (l-p)th
percentile of a standard normal distribution. In
practice, since the p^'s are generally not known
in advance, the investigador usually either (a)
provides an educated guess as to their magnitude
based on (i) previuos work or (ii) as assessment
of what would constitute a meaningful therapeu-
tic effect or (b) substitutos p. for p . if a pi-
lot study has been performed.         If the pilot study
is small in magnitude and the resulting standard
errors of the p . are large, then the latter
approach can potentially      lead to serious errors

in the sample size estimates since the p- will

12


be     poor estimates of the p.. In Section 2, we
present a more realistic method for using pilot
study material to estímate sample size which
takes account of (a) the estimation error in the
p., and (b) the prior Information regarding (i)
the underlying rate in the control group and
(ii) the magnitude of what is considered a mea-
ningful therapeutic effect. In Section 3,' power
comparisons are given comparing our estimates
with those provided by (1.1). An example is gi-
ven in Section 4 illustrating the use of these
methods.



2. Theory.

      We adopt a Bayesian approach to this pro-
biem. In particular, if one a priori expects p.
to be TT . and ranging from m .IT . to M -TT . then one
         't                     't-   A.-   ^ f   •^^


may parametrize the prior distribution as a Beta
with    expected    valué ir - and standard deviation
a . where oa . = M .ir .-wi-TT . for some pre-specif ied
q , m . , M - , I = 0,1. One can interpret TTWTT        =
Relative Risk as an expression of the expected
therapeutic effect in comparing the treatment
with the control group. In addition, q is the
number of standard deviations equal to the ran-
ge of p.. It can be easily shown that the para-
meters a.» 6 . of the above Beta distributions

                                                                         13

are given by


        t± _ _^i _ '?^i-^x:>                   - 1,       -C = o, 1.    (2.1)
         A,             A,   ÍM . - m . )   TT ,


It then foilows immediately from the properties
of the binomial distribution that the posterior
distribution of p. given the pilot study dada
is :

                   Xj+a.-l            '^y-Xy+fay-l f       xj+a.— l
 ^ ¿ P l \ P l } - Pl        ^'-Pl^ ^ ^ ^ /J p , ^ ^ .
                                                    P•
                                                    ^=°               (2.2)

                 .(1-p^) -^ -^ ^ cíp^.             ^ = 0,1

i.e. p, given p . foilows a Beta distribution
with parameters X .+a . and n .-X • + b . . If one uses
standard power calculatlons for the two sample
binomial probiem, then for a specific W and ot
the power (TT(W,a|p ,p.)) conditional on p and
p, can be expressed in the form:


  TT(W,a|p^,pp = ^í-z^^^ + t^^ /Vp^q^+p^q^ )


                        + ^í-z^/2-^^/^Po%+Pl'Íl ^                     ^2.3)

where A = p - a . It then foilows immediately
from (2.2) and (2.3) that the expected posterior

14


power X(W,n,p,a) is given by:


     X(M,w,p,a) - J     j       ^(W,a|p^,pj)g^(p^|p^).
                   ^ = 0 Pl=°        ^           (2.4)
                            '9^iPl\Pl)<ÍPldp^.

                                         A.

We will subsequently refer to X(W,n,p,a) as the
"probabilistic" power in comparison to the "de-
terministic" power obtained from substituting
p    for p   and p. for p, in (2.3) as foilows:

    X*(W,p,a) = $(-z^^2+A/Rr/,/^J^+j5Jj)


              + *(-Z^/2-^^^*^P7V^PI^>             <2.5)

          p^o-p,.
where A = "   "^ 1 We note that A is a function of
N , n , p and a while X is only a function of W.jp,
a since the deterministic power is not affected
by the sample size used in the pilot study. It
is of interest to note that the deterministic
power is the probabilistic power for the case
when the posterior distribution of p. has all
its mass at p ..

listic powers are dramatic in most instances.
In particular, if p /p, ^ TT /TT then the deter
                   o  1     o 1                —
ministic power is usually much larger than ei-
ther probabilistic power. For example, if p =
.10 = TT , p, = .05 = TT, , N = 1000, then the de-
        o "^ 1           1
terministic power is 0.99 while the probabilis-
tic powers are 0.80 and 0.81 for n = 20 and 40
respectively. Conversely, if p /p «       TT /'ÍT , , then
the deterministic power is generally smaller than
either probabilistic power. For example, if p          =
.20, p   = .15, N = 400, then the deterministic
power if 0.46 while the probabilistic      powers
are 0.66 for both n = 20 and 40 respectively.
Thus, if one uses the deterministic      sample size
method in (1.1) to assess the appropriate sample
size to achieve a prespecified power, then one
will tend to underes tima te the appropriate sam-
pie size for large p / p . . and overestimate   the
appropriate sample size for small p /p,.

     In general, the probabilistic powers are
similar for n = 20 and 40. If p       > p,, then the
                                  o      1
probabilistic   power for w = 40 is usually lar-
ger than for n = 20, while if p       = p., then the
opposite is true with the difference in the two
powers being 4:0.13 in all instances and ^0.05
in most instantes. The difference in the assess^
ments of power using the deterministic and pro-
babilistic methods were similar to those given

                                                    19


above when TT , N, n   and p were held fixed and m,
M and q were allowed to vary.




4. Example.

     An área of recent investigation has been
the ascertainment of risk factors during the pr£
natal period to identity women destined to deli-
ver low birthweight    (<2500 gm.) infants. One risk
factor which has been extensively studied in low
income populatlons is the presence of U. Urealy-
ticuta obtained from a vaginal culture at the
first prenatal visit (Kass et al. (1981)). A cli^
nical trial is planned in a prenatal clinic
attended by women of a higher socioeconomic sta-
tus based on women who are initially positive
for U. Urealyticum. The 'investigators plan to
randomize an equal number of women to (a) ery-
thromycin, a drug which is expected to elimínate
U. Urealyticum and reduce the proportion of low
birthweight infants or (b) placebo. Since the
prevalence rate of low birthweight varíes inve£
sely with socieconomic status, the results      of
the previous study could not be used to help es^
tímate sample size in the proposed    study and a
pilot study was conducted for this purpose. The
results of the pilot study indicated that      of
twenty women who were treated with     erythromycin

20


only one delivered a low birthweight   infant
(p. = 0.05), whxle of twenty women who were treat^
ed with placebo two delivered a low birthweight
infant (p   = 0.10).

     We see from (2.5) that if we use the dete£
ministic power calculation method, then we would
need to recruit 430 pregnant women in each group
in the large study in order to have an 80% chan-
ce of detecting a slgnificant difference using
a two-sided test with a = .05. However, if      we
compute the probabilistic power from (2.4) using
the same prior parameters as in Table 1, then
we would require   1000 pregnant women in each
group in order to achieve the same type I and
type II error. Similar results would be obtain-
ed if 40 pregnant women obtained for each group
in the pilot study and p   and p.. are maintained
at .10 and .05 respectively. Thus, we see that
the deterministic method grossly   underestimates
the appropriate sample size in this case.

     In contrast, suppose that 40 pregnant women
had been obtained for each group in the pilot
study with four of the placebo women (p     =0.10)
                                       A.


and three of the erythromycin women (p. = 0.075)
delivering a low birthweight   infant. If one uses
the same prior parameters as in Table 1 and the
same type I and type II errors as above, then

                                                    21

from (2.4) and (2.5) it foilows that one would
need approximately      1400 women in each group in
the large study using the probabilistic method
and 1550 women in each group using the determi-
nistic method. Thus, in this case the determi-
nistic method overestimates the appropriate
sample size.




5. Discussion.

          In this paper, a method is provided for
using pilot study data in the estimation of sam
pie size. This method enables one to combine
prior Information concerning      (a) the underly-
ing disease rate in the control group (TT ) and
(b) the relative risk of disease in the treat-
ment group as compared with the control group
      ) with the results of the pilot study to
(TT./TT
  1 o
obtain sample size estimates for a prespecified
type I and type II error. These "probabilistic"
sample size estimates have been compared with
classical deterministic sample size estimates.
The deterministic method generally underesti-
mates the appropriate sample size for a prespe^
cified type I and type II error for the larger
proposed study of p /p, >, "T /TTJ and generally
overestimates the appropriate sample size if
P /p, < 'T /ir,. There is often at least a two-
'^o «^l   o 1

22


fold difference in the sample size estimates
using the two methods to achieve a given type I
and type II error. Thus, this should make one
cautious about using the deterministic sample
size method based on pilot study material espe-
cialiy when the number of subjects studied      in
the pilot study is small.

     In many instances, a large body of previ-
ously collected data exists which is similar
enough to the proposed large study so that one
can use this material directly for purposes of
sample size estimation. In other instances, one
will be able to specify what would be a meaning-
ful therapeutic effect even in the absence of
previous data directly applicable to the pro-
posed study. In both cases, determistic sample
size estimates obtained from inverting   (2.5)for
a prespecified a and 3 are typically employed.
In contrast, if no large body of previous data
exists and in addition it is difficult to spe-
cify the magnitude of what woul constitute     a
meaningful therapeutic effect, then a small pi-
lot study many be employed to augment existing
Information. In this case, deterministic    sample
size estimates can be be misleading and proba-
bilistic sample size estimates obtained by inver
ting (2.4) for a prespecified a and 8 will be
most useful. On the other hand, it should    be

                                                            23


noted that if the size of the pilot study is ve-
ry large as would effectively be the case if a
large body of previously collected data exists
and we regard this as a "pilot" study, then the
probabilistic and deterministic sample size es-
timates will be very similar since the posterior
distribution g.(p.lp.) will be nearly the same
as a distribution whose entire probability mass
is at p . .         Similarly, the closer m. and M- are
(e.g., M. = 1.05, m. = 0.95) the closer ,q.(p.|p.)
          Xt               A^                    X,    X,   X.

will be to the distribución whose entire proba-
bility mass is at TT .. Thus the methodology present
ed here is flexible enough to permit the assess-
ment of the sample size to be based mainly on
the consideration of the minimal therapeutic
effect (TT ./TT ) which would be thought to be cli-
               A,    o
nically significant.
